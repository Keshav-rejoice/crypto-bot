he United States Federal Reserve’s recent decision to cut interest rates for the first time since March 2020 is expected to impact the income streams of the top five centralized stablecoins.

According to a report by CCData released on September 27, these stablecoins, which collectively hold nearly $125 billion in U.S. Treasury bills, could lose approximately $625 million in interest income for each 50-basis-point (bps) rate cut.

The report reveals that Treasury bills constitute 80.2% of the reserves held by major stablecoins.

As a result, any reduction in interest rates directly affects their revenue.

Market Anticipates 75bps in Rate Cust by End of 2024
Data from CME Group’s FedWatch tool indicates that the market anticipates a total of 75 bps in rate cuts by the end of 2024, including a 50-bps cut in November and an additional 25-bps cut in December.

If these predictions materialize, stablecoins could face an additional revenue loss of $937.5 million, bringing the total potential loss from the Fed’s easing policy to $1.5625 billion.


Among the affected stablecoins, Tether’s USDT holds the largest share of Treasury-backed reserves, amounting to $93.2 billion in T-bills and repurchase agreements.

Tether reported a net profit of $5.2 billion in the first half of 2024, largely driven by higher interest rates.

Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) follows with $28.7 billion in Treasury holdings through its Circle Reserve Fund.

Other stablecoins such as First Digital USD (FDUSD), PayPal USD (PYUSD), and TrueUSD (TUSD) hold smaller Treasury positions of $1.83 billion, $634 million, and $502 million, respectively.

The expected decline in interest rates is likely to put additional pressure on their profit margins as well.

Despite these potential financial setbacks, the stablecoin market has shown resilience.

In September, the total market capitalization of stablecoins increased by 1.50% to reach $172 billion, marking the 12th consecutive month of growth, according to CCData.

However, the overall market cap remains below pre-May 2022 levels, before the Terra Luna depegging event.

Trading volumes on centralized exchanges have also seen a downturn, falling by 39.4% to $683 billion as of September 23.

USDT continues to dominate the stablecoin market, accounting for 77.2% of all trading volume on centralized exchanges.

FDUSD is the second most traded stablecoin, holding an 11.6% market share, followed by USDC with 10.9%.

Japanese Megabanks to Trial Cross-Border Stablecoin Transfer
As reported, Japan’s top three megabanks are launching a pilot project aimed at speeding up international settlements using stablecoins.

The initiative, called “Project Pax,” will involve stablecoins issued by Progmat, a blockchain platform supported by SBI Holdings and Japan Exchange Group.

The banks involved include Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), and Mizuho.

The trial, which also involves blockchain companies Datachain and TOKI, will explore the use of cross-chain technology for faster and more efficient transactions.

Meanwhile, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse has revealed that the company is in the process of launching a stablecoin in Japan soon.
Saturday 28 September 2024 – Mega Dice ($DICE) has announced that its presale will close on September 30, with a listing on Raydium at 15:00 CET.

With over 50,000 active players generating more than $50 million in monthly wagers, Mega Dice stands out as a leading crypto casino and Solana’s top GameFi project.

It’s no wonder the project has secured an impressive $1.9 million in funding from early contributors.

With the presale ending in less than 48 hours, investors have a brief window to purchase $DICE at the discounted price of $0.116056.

Given Mega Dice’s existing success, the token price is likely to see a significant increase upon listing, benefiting from enhanced liquidity and greater accessibility for investors.

Additionally, presale buyers can look forward to an airdrop that will begin once trading starts, with final details to be unveiled post-listing.
Ripple (XRP) is holding steady at nearly $0.6100, bolstered by positive sentiment in the crypto market and Bitcoin’s surge to $66,000. Analysts predict a potential rally for XRP, with some targeting a long-term increase to $31.

This optimism stems from rising institutional interest and expectations of favourable regulations, which could strengthen XRP’s position despite ongoing challenges with the SEC.
nprecedented 888% Surge Predicted Despite Immediate Hurdles!
Market analyst EGRAG predicts XRP could surge by 888% if it reclaims its previous highs. He compares current price action to a 2017 pattern, where XRP hit a key support line four times before entering a massive bull run.
EGRAG’s bold forecast could fuel investor confidence, potentially driving higher demand and boosting XRP’s market performance.

Ripple vs. SEC: Legal Battle Intensifies as XRP’s Price Awaits Clarity
The Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit is drawing attention again as a former SEC lawyer suggests the agency may appeal Judge Analisa Torres’s July 2023 ruling, which determined that XRP itself is not a security.

With the October 7 appeal deadline approaching, legal experts are debating the potential impact on the case and the broader market.
Attorney John Deaton believes the SEC could face difficulties proving its case using the Howey Test, while others question whether an appeal truly aligns with investor protection goals.

Meanwhile, Ripple is moving forward with plans to launch its RLUSD stablecoin and expand the XRP Ledger, despite the regulatory uncertainty.

Some analysts argue that a potential appeal could further strain the SEC’s credibility, especially if new regulations favor the crypto market.

As Ripple’s legal saga unfolds, XRP’s price remains around $0.5840, consolidating amid ongoing speculation.

However, positive regulatory developments or a dismissal of the appeal could push XRP above key resistance levels and restore investor confidence.
XRP/USD is currently trading at $0.6070, maintaining a solid upward trajectory following a bullish breakout from the symmetrical triangle pattern.

This move occurred around the $0.5965 level, pushing XRP to an intra-day high of $0.6119 before consolidating slightly lower.
The symmetrical triangle breakout suggests strong bullish momentum, with the price now eyeing immediate resistance at $0.6178.

A successful break above this level could open the door for XRP to target $0.6228, followed by the key resistance at $0.6278.

On the downside, immediate support is positioned at $0.6032, with further support levels at $0.5965 and $0.5845.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 65.50, indicating bullish momentum but nearing overbought territory. Meanwhile, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.5910 underpins near-term support.

Key Insights:
Bullish Breakout: XRP has broken above the symmetrical triangle, suggesting further upside potential.
Immediate Resistance at $0.6178: A break above this could see a retest of the $0.6228 resistance.
Support at $0.6032: Holding this level is crucial for maintaining bullish momentum in the short term.
Overall, the breakout and solid buying interest suggest a continuation of the bullish trend, provided XRP remains above the $0.6032 support level.

As XRP gains momentum in the crypto space, another promising opportunity is making waves—introducing the Memebet Token presale, the future of meme coin casinos.

Bitcoin (BTC) saw a brief pullback but continued its upward momentum, holding steady at around $65,500. This positive trend coincided with the early release of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) from California’s Lompoc II detention center.

His release is expected to restore confidence in Binance’s operations and alleviate market uncertainty, contributing to Bitcoin’s recent gains.

Adding to this optimism, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a substantial $494 million inflow on September 27, pushing the weekly total above $1 billion.

These developments suggest rising institutional interest, which could propel Bitcoin prices even higher.
Zhao’s Early Release Spurs Market Confidence May Benefit Bitcoin
Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was released early from California’s Lompoc II detention center after serving a four-month sentence.

His release, two days ahead of schedule, followed a weekend policy allowing early release when the date falls on a weekend.
Following his release, Binance Coin (BNB) saw modest gains. Although CZ resigned as CEO, he agreed to pay a $50 million fine and faces a lifetime ban from returning to the role. However, he remains the majority shareholder of the company.

Zhao’s lenient sentence—initially sought at three years by U.S. prosecutors—was reduced due to his clean record and strong character references.

Despite legal issues, CZ has significant support in the crypto community, with many curious about his future impact on Binance.
Key Points:

Market Impact: Zhao’s release could stabilize Binance operations and boost trading activity.
Bitcoin Outlook: Positive sentiment may benefit BTC and broader crypto markets.
Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge by $1.1B, Signaling Strong Institutional Optimism
Bitcoin ETFs saw a major inflow of $494 million on September 27, bringing the weekly total to over $1.1 billion. The ARK 21Shares ETF led with $203 million, while Fidelity and BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs added $124 million and $110.8 million, respectively.

Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust also gained $26.2 million after a two-week drought.
This surge highlights growing institutional confidence and suggests a potential Bitcoin rally in the fourth quarter.

Global monetary easing, including new measures from the People’s Bank of China, is driving renewed interest in Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty.
Key Points:

Strong ETF Inflows: Over $1.1 billion, led by ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, and BlackRock.
Institutional Optimism: Reflects bullish outlook and potential for a Q4 rally.
China’s Impact: New liquidity measures boost investor interest in BTC.
Overall, the rise in Bitcoin ETF inflows points to increased institutional demand and sets the stage for a potential price rally in the coming months.

Daily Technical Outlook: Bitcoin (BTC/USD) – September 28
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading at $65,550, down 0.15% in the last 24 hours, showing signs of a potential reversal.

The cryptocurrency faces immediate support at $65,350, which coincides with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

A breakdown below this level could lead to further downside pressure, with the next support targets at $64,790 and $64,170.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has slipped below 50, suggesting bearish momentum. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at $66,250, followed by $66,860 and $67,560.

Key Insights:

Immediate Support at $65,350: A break below could extend losses to $64,790.
RSI Below 50: Indicates increased selling pressure and a potential bearish trend.
Resistance at $66,250: Bulls must reclaim this level to regain upward momentum.
Overall, Bitcoin’s movement hinges on its ability to hold above the 50-EMA and maintain support at $65,350. A decisive move below this level could accelerate the bearish trend.
Why Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) Is a Strong Addition to Your Crypto Portfolio
Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) has quickly gained attention as an emerging cryptocurrency with promising growth potential. Early investors are particularly interested in its presale phase and lucrative staking options.

Presale Advantage
Investing in $PEPU during its presale offers an opportunity for significant gains. With experts like Jacob Crypto Bury encouraging early participation, investors can capitalize on the next price increase.

Currently, the token is priced at $0.00985, and with the presale nearing its cap, the next price hike is imminent.

Passive Income Through Staking
The 499% APY staking feature is a major draw for investors seeking passive income. This high yield is a compelling reason why $PEPU is seen as a strong addition to any crypto portfolio. Already, 321 million $PEPU tokens have been staked, underscoring investor confidence in its long-term potential.

Pepe Unchained has raised over $15.5 million, nearly reaching its $15.7 million presale goal. This milestone, combined with thorough security audits by Coinsult and SolidProof, ensures that $PEPU is a transparent and secure investment.
A fraudulent cryptocurrency wallet app on Google Play has reportedly stolen $70,000 from users in a sophisticated scam that has been described as a world-first for targeting mobile users exclusively.

The malicious app, named WalletConnect, mimicked the reputable WalletConnect protocol but was, in fact, a sophisticated scheme to drain crypto wallets.

The deceptive app managed to deceive over 10,000 users into downloading it, according to Check Point Research (CPR), the cybersecurity firm that uncovered the scam.
Scammers Market Fraudulent App as Solution to Web3 Issues
The scammers behind the app were well aware of the typical challenges faced by web3 users, such as compatibility issues and the lack of widespread support for WalletConnect across different wallets.

They cleverly marketed the fraudulent app as a solution to these problems, taking advantage of the absence of an official WalletConnect app on the Play Store.

Coupled with a slew of fake positive reviews, the app appeared legitimate to unsuspecting users.
While the app was downloaded over 10,000 times, CPR’s investigation identified transactions linked to more than 150 crypto wallets, indicating the number of individuals who actually fell victim to the scam.

Once installed, the app prompted users to link their wallets, claiming to offer secure and seamless access to web3 applications.

However, as users authorized transactions, they were redirected to a malicious website that harvested their wallet details, including the blockchain network and known addresses.

Exploiting the mechanics of smart contracts, the attackers were able to initiate unauthorized transfers, siphoning off valuable cryptocurrency tokens from the victims’ wallets.
Despite the app’s malicious intent, only 20 victims left negative reviews on the Play Store, which were quickly overshadowed by numerous fake positive reviews.

This allowed the app to remain undetected for five months until its true nature was exposed and it was removed from the platform in August.

“This incident serves as a wake-up call for the entire digital asset community,” said Alexander Chailytko, cybersecurity, research, and innovation manager at CPR.

He emphasized the need for advanced security solutions to prevent such sophisticated attacks, urging both users and developers to take proactive steps to secure their digital assets.

Google Removes Malicious Versions of CPR App
Google, in response to these findings, stated that all malicious versions of the app identified by CPR were removed before the report’s publication.

The tech giant highlighted that its Google Play Protect feature is designed to automatically protect Android users against known threats, even when they stem from outside the Play Store.
The incident follows a recent campaign exposed by Kaspersky, in which 11 million Android users unknowingly downloaded apps infected with Necro malware, resulting in unauthorized subscription charges.

In another attempt, Cybersecurity scammers are using automated email replies to compromise systems and deliver stealthy crypto mining malware.

This comes on the heels of another malware threat identified in August.

The “Cthulhu Stealer,” which affects MacOS systems, similarly disguises itself as legitimate software and targets personal information, including MetaMask passwords, IP addresses, and cold wallet private keys.
Merchants can now accept cryptocurrency payments without fear of common issues through the new SpacePay solution. SpacePay is creating various tools to make it easy for everyone to use cryptocurrencies for daily transactions and business operations.

With its innovative offerings, the platform aims to become a household name by providing solutions to major cryptocurrency limitations.

It’s common to see even those familiar with cryptocurrencies reject crypto payments due to price volatility. It doesn’t make sense to accept BNB, for example, for payment of goods or services when its value could plummet almost immediately after the transaction.

Conversely, buyers who pay with BNB might feel cheated if the token’s value rises shortly after the transaction, because they could have paid less for the same goods or services if they had waited.

SpacePay solves this by eliminating volatility’s impact on cryptocurrency prices. When customers pay for goods or services, merchants receive payment in their local currencies.

The platform automatically converts the paid crypto to the merchant’s desired currency, ensuring they always receive the agreed-upon price without fear of value fluctuations.
Beyond volatility, cryptocurrency systems and applications are known to be complex since they are different from the traditionally known payment methods. Users are usually required to learn new ways to transact, download apps, and carry out other new activities different from the traditional method.

SpacePay simplifies this process by integrating with more than 325 payment wallets, allowing users to continue using their existing payment systems.

Users can access SpacePay through their existing payment machines and traditional point-of-sale systems. They don’t have to navigate complex processes to make transactions, as they can send or receive money by scanning a simple QR code.

While traditional payment systems often have long processing times, which can be unfavorable for businesses needing instant settlement, SpacePay ensures zero waiting time when using its solution.
Additionally, users won’t pay heavy fees for SpacePay’s solution, as the platform charges only a 0.5% merchant fee on all transactions. Users can be sure of the amount receivers will get, with no hidden charges or fees, as the platform is transparent about its pricing.

SpacePay operates on a decentralized payment system to ensure greater security, privacy, and efficiency for all users. Transactions are secured through robust cryptography to reduce the risk of fraud and unauthorized access.

It ensures users retain complete control over their funds and private keys, helping them manage their finances securely without third-party interference.

SpacePay’s transparent and unique offerings are designed to foster trust and confidence among users.
Increased Demand Could Boost SPY’s Value
Solutions like SpacePay could easily attract new users and increase crypto adoption. As a result, its native SPY token could become a major force in the crypto world, as increased use of SpacePay’s solution could also increase demand for the token.

Holding SPY offers benefits; for example, the platform will share revenue with users, providing passive income through the SPY token. Active participants on the platform will also be eligible for monthly loyalty airdrops, incentivizing SPY holding and potentially increasing the token’s value.

A token with such utility could see its price spike following its launch on centralized and decentralized exchanges, making now potentially the best time to buy and hold it. 1 SPY token is currently selling at $0.00191 in the ongoing presale, which could be its lowest price as it will increase steadily through different presale stages.

Tokens with utility that solve major problems often see high demand, potentially causing a major spike following the presale.
Buy SPY Token to Enjoy Early Benefits
Buying the SPY token is a straightforward process. Visit the SpacePay website and click on the presale option. This will open a page where you can connect your wallet by clicking “Buy Now” or “Connect Wallet.” You’ll then see available wallet options for securing your tokens.

You can buy the token with ETH, BNB, USDC, USDT, AVAX, BASE, MATIC, or your bank card. Ensure you fund your chosen option.

After connecting your wallet, you can swap your desired crypto for SPY tokens. Securing tokens makes you a member of a SpacePay community open to enjoying potential future benefits. You’ll be able to claim your purchased tokens after the presale ends.
Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao was released from prison on Friday after serving 118 days of his four-month sentence.

His early release, attributed to federal guidelines allowing for weekend releases, follows a guilty plea issued in April for violating US anti-money laundering laws during his time as Binance CEO.

The court ordered CZ to pay a personal fine of $50 million, while Binance received a separate penalty of $4.3 billion.

Despite his legal troubles and time behind bars, Fortune’s report indicates that Zhao retains a massive personal fortune, estimated to be over $60 billion. His release has sparked speculation within the cryptocurrency community about his potential impact on the market, particularly regarding the future of Binance Coin (BNB).
BNB Sees Uptick as CZ Returns to Public Eye
Since Zhao’s release, BNB has experienced gains of nearly 7%. Although he is no longer at the helm of Binance, some analysts suggest that his influence within the crypto industry could bring a sense of stability to the market, potentially even driving growth.
Coinciding with CZ’s return to freedom, a recent study by the Social Capital Markets team revealed an important trend in the legal side of the cryptocurrency industry.
The study found that crypto-related crime convictions increased by 267% between 2019 and 2023. Analysts point out that this growth highlights the increasing effectiveness of law enforcement agencies in prosecuting such crimes.

Additionally, the report indicates a broader trend of increased scrutiny and legal action in the industry, with a 300% overall increase in convictions over the past decade.

The combined prison time handed down to convicted crypto leaders now totals 272 years. This rise in crypto-based convictions underscores the concerted effort by regulatory bodies like the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DoJ) to crack down on illicit activities within the industry.
In wake of Bitcoin (BTC) hitting two-month highs on Friday above $66,000, and looking to have convincingly broken back above its 200DMA and snapped its recent multi-month downtrend, traders are assessing what might be the best crypto to buy now ahead of what could be a very bullish October.

September is normally one of the worst months of the year for major cryptos.

But Bitcoin is set to end the month up nearly 12%, setting up the prospect of an even stronger October, which is already the strongest month of the year for Bitcoin.

The impressive rally comes in wake of the Fed kicking off a new monetary policy easing cycle with a 50bps rate cut last week, and other major global central banks like China’s PBoC following suit.

Bitcoin to $100K?
Markets are expecting significant Fed interest rate easing in the coming years which investors are hoping will keep the US economy out of recession.

Weaker than expected US inflation data on Friday only fed into that narrative, helping push BTC above $66,000.
A positive macro backdrop, the alleviation of US election uncertainty in November and the delayed bullish impact of the April BTC halving could all kick in together to power Bitcoin to fresh record highs in Q4, with a charge towards $100,000 possible.
The prospect of 50% gains for BTC from current levels suggests that, for many investors, it might be the best crypto to buy now.

However, some investors hungry to 3, 4 or even 5x their portfolios are turning to the higher beta altcoin market.

After all, Bitcoin breakout in Q4 could trigger a new altcoin/meme coin season.
Here are some strong performers on Friday that might be the best crypto to buy now.

Best Crypto to Buy Now in the Altcoin Market
Tap-to-earn GameFi crypto Notcoin (NOT) is the top crypto performer today in the top 100 coins by market cap.

Per CoinMarketCap, it has surged an impressive 20% in the past 24 hours, taking its price back above $0.10.

The surge comes in wake of NOT breaking above a downtrend in play since the June highs, and with NOT breaking back above its 50DMA at $0.09.
The breakout opens the prospect of a swift rally back towards June’s highs in the $0.29 area, which would mark gains of nearly 3x from current levels.

That could easily rank it as the best crypto to buy now.

Two other coins performing very well on Friday are Bonk (BONK) and Pepe (PEPE), up around 12% each in the past 24 hours.

Bonk’s jump to $0.000023 has seen it retest its 200DMA.

The trend in both meme coins appears to be changing, and the rally could soon go into overdrive if a new meme season beckons.

Both are leading meme coins backed by massive dedicated communities.

That means its highly likely that both coins will be leading movers in a future meme market surge.

For investors looking to gain exposure to the volatile but fast growing meme coin space, BONK and PEPE could well rank as the best crypto to buy now.

Alternatively, investors might want to check out meme coin presales.

Presales offer investors the chance to get into high potential projects before they go viral and at a low valuation.

If investors can identify high potential projects that go on to gain market traction, they can make big returns.

Meme coin presales can be particularly profitable. Here are some of the best new meme coins, according to experts at Cryptonews.com.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday filed settled charges against Solana dApp Mango DAO and Blockworks Foundation over the unregistered offer and sale of $70 million worth of MGNO token tokens, which the agency deems as crypto asset security.
Without admitting or denying the allegations, Mango DAO agreed to pay the SEC $700,000 and destroy their MNGO tokens.

The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) will also ask exchanges to halt the trading of MNGO tokens.

The SEC also charged Mango DAO developer Mango Labs LLC for engaging in unregistered broker activity, charges that were also settled.

As part of a statement, the SEC argued that Mango Market’s DAO status did not change the fact that MNGO tokens should have been registered.
“Our view has been that the label ‘DAO’ does not change… whether their activities need to be registered,” the SEC’s Acting Chief of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit said.

Mango DAO – Another Victim of the SEC’s Crackdown
Mango DAO is the latest crypto firm/entity to fall fowl of the SEC, which has been crusading to exercise jurisdiction over the industry since 2022 and reign in and industry that it claims is rife with incompliance to securities rules.

In a recent SEC interview on CNBC, SEC Chair Gary Gensler argued that the firm’s dozens of lawsuits against major industry players are intended to create a safe environment for investors.

“This field will not long survive if you can’t build that investor trust in the markets”, he stated.

The SEC Chair has, in the past, expressed his opinion that virtually all cryptos aside from Bitcoin are unregistered crypto asset securities.

The agency begrudgingly approved spot Ethereum ETFs earlier in the year, a tacit admission that they also don’t view Ethereum as a security.

Crypto investors are hoping that the next US presidential term will bring with it more favorable crypto industry policy – the Biden administration has been a stanch supporter of the SEC’s aggressive anti-crypto stance.

Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump has come out as ardently pro-crypto in 2024, throwing his support behind Bitcoin, and promoting a DeFi project created by a group involving his sons called World Liberty Financial.

Sitting VP and Democrat Presidential nominee Kamala Harris, meanwhile, hasn’t said much about crypto, beyond her desire to nurture innovation in the space.
With Bitcoin (BTC) and other major altcoins set to end the typically bearish month of September with strong gains thanks to optimism surrounding a new Fed-led global liquidity easing cycle, meme coins might be about to go into overdrive this October.

In contrast to September, October is typically one of the strongest months of the year for cryptos.

There are already signs that a new meme season is underway, and traders are scrambling to pre-position themselves ahead of a potential October meme coin surge.

The biggest meme coin in the market, Dogecoin (DOGE), recently snapped a long-term downtrend and hit two-month highs.
Major coins like DOGE and SHIB could post 2, 3, or even 4x gains by the end of the year.

However, many meme coin investors are looking for much bigger upside potential and will thus consider riskier, smaller, and lesser-known meme coins.

Here are some high-potential October meme coins to watch.

October Meme Coins to Watch – Which Could Be the Best to Buy Now?
SunDog (SUNDOG)
One of Tron’s leading meme coins, Sundog (SUNDOG), which is named in part after Tron’s eccentric founder Justin Sun, could be one of the top October meme coins to watch.

According to DEXScreener, its market cap was last $360 million, but it has been steadily creeping higher in the last few days.
ndeed, since its launch in mid-August, it hasn’t really been in a notable downtrend.

This reflects steady growth in its notoriety and fame in recent weeks – its official X page had around 116,000 followers, while its Telegram community had nearly 17,000 members.

As meme season returns, traders are likely to hunt for leading meme coins on the different blockchains.

With Sundog at the top of the pile on the Tron blockchain, its outlook for October is very good.

It could easily become a multi-billion dollar coin before the end of the year, posting 5-10x gains.
Crypto All-stars (STARS)
An innovative new meme coin staking protocol called Crypto All-stars (STARS) is making waves in meme coin and DeFi circles.

Crypto All-stars, currently available in presale, will allow holders of all major meme coins to earn a big STARS yield when they stake their tokens in the protocol’s exciting MemeVault.

The MemeVault will launch soon, but in the meantime, presale investors can already get started earning a massive yield by staking their STARS bag.

Per the project’s official website, STARS staking yields were last around 885%.

At that rate, STARS presale investors could more or less double their STARS bag just a few weeks before the launch of the MemeVault.

Crypto All-stars sits at the intersection of meme coin and DeFi degeneracy. It could be one of the best October meme coins to watch.
As of Friday, the presale had raised an impressive $1.7 million. Interested investors better move quickly before it expires.

Turbo (TURBO)
ChatGPT-created meme coin Turbo (TURBO) is another one to watch out for in the potential upcoming October meme season.

According to DEXScreener, TURBO’s market cap has nearly doubled since mid-September to around $450 million.
Turbo’s $450 million market cap leaves plenty of room for growth if meme coin markets really go crazy.

TURBO is another October meme coin to watch that could be 10x before the year’s end.
Bolivia has experienced a massive surge in crypto transactions over the past three months following new regulations that legalized the use of digital payment channels.

According to a recent announcement from the Central Bank of Bolivia, the country’s monthly trading volume of virtual assets rose from $7.6 million to $15.6 million, driven mainly by stablecoin transactions and increased public interest.

Increase in Trading Volume and Transactions
The Central Bank of Bolivia attributed this growth to implementing Board Resolution 082/2024, which came into effect in June, enabling the use of electronic payment channels for virtual assets.

The number of virtual asset transactions also saw a sharp rise, with over 1.1 million transactions recorded from July to September, compared to around 932,000 in the previous six months. Individuals conducted the majority of these transactions.
In addition, the Financial System Supervision Authority (ASFI) reported that six financial institutions have begun operating with virtual assets, further integrating these digital instruments into Bolivia’s financial system.

In addition, the Financial System Supervision Authority (ASFI) reported that six financial institutions have begun operating with virtual assets, further integrating these digital instruments into Bolivia’s financial system.


Based on the report, the data showed a 40% increase in operations among these institutions between July and August.

Utilizing Digital Assets to Advance Bolivia’s Economy
To support this expansion, the Central Bank has launched an educational initiative to inform the public about the characteristics and risks associated with virtual assets. Over 33 workshops have been conducted nationwide, reaching more than 3,000 participants.

The bank’s president, Edwin Rojas Ulo, highlighted that this move is part of a broader strategy to modernize the economy and strengthen international commercial and financial activities.

“The BCB is paving the way for the use of crypto assets in Bolivia. Our country is taking huge steps towards a future economy with greater use of accessible digital instruments,” said Ulo at a press conference.

The legal framework allows Bolivians to use virtual assets for cross-border transactions and e-commerce payments.

Web3’s first meme coin casino Memebet Casino is barely a fortnight into its $MEMEBET presale, but already the token has raised over $300,000 amidst an explosive meme coin rally that saw the extra volatile sector advance an eye-watering 18% in 24 hours to post a collective market cap of $55.3 billion.
Memebet Casino is riding the crest of the wave of a meme coin gold rush that has added double-digit percentage gains to most leading projects over the last 7 days, including Shiba Inu ($SHIB), which is up nearly 40%, while Pepe ($PEPE) and DogWifHat ($WIF) both advanced 30%.

There is also heavy speculation in the sector right now, with some of most rapidly growing projects being recent launches like the year-old Mog Coin ($MOG) and Neiro ($NEIRO), both of which kept pace with Pepe and DogWifHat this week.

Meanwhile, Moo Deng ($MOODENG), a meme coin tribute to a viral baby pygmy hippo in Thailand which launched a fortnight ago—about the same time as the Memebet Casino presale—is up a sweltering 945%.

In general, crypto markets responded positively to the US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates after two years and eleven consecutive hikes that saw American borrowing costs hit their highest level in twenty-two years last summer.

As borrowing costs come down, investors move into risk-on positions, and this has been broadly reflected by crypto’s rebound since the announcement.
All told, we could be looking at Uptober next month, which means Memebet Casino’s presale couldn’t come at a more timely moment. After all, $MEMEBET straddles two of the most explosive sub-sectors within crypto: meme coins and Web3 gambling (GambleFi).

Meme Coins: Here To Stay? Unlock Their Gaming Potential in Memebet Casino
Meme coins like Dogecoin ($DOGE) and its many copycats may have started as a parody, but their fun and irreverent nature quickly inspired loyal and large communities, many of them sincere crypto fans who see encapsulated in them crypto’s founding ethos of independence and decentralization.

Now, their progenitors are accommodating growing demand for them by giving them new utilities. Shiba Inu is enhancing privacy features and building an ecosystem around its proprietary Ethereum Layer 2, Shibarium, while Floki is currently testing trading bot functionality.
Outside of the projects themselves, very few projects are accommodating meme coins seriously. That’s where Memebet steps in. Given the already rapid explosion of both meme coins and gambling within crypto, Memebet Casin is a significant step towards integrating meme coins in Web3’s economy as tender.

Memebet Merges GambleFi and Meme Coins as AltSeason Begins.
With online gambling primed to explode from a $100 billion industry in 2024 to $130 billion within the next five years, both crypto and iGaming will rise in tandem and intersect in novel ways and both will be shaped by regulation in the coming years.

The Fed’s recent rate cut announcement had a very telling impact on the volatile meme coin market. According to CoinGecko, the sector grew around 7% in the 24 hours after the announcement as a clear signal from traders that fall is Meme Coin Season.

Given the projected growth in both crypto and online gambling, Memebet is in a prime position at the convergence of both to become Web3’s first multimillion-dollar meme coin casino.

Pepe Price Analysis – PEPE Becomes Best Performer in the Market
Pepe may be one of the best-performing in the sector right now, but there are several indications that it’s due to cool off soon.

Firstly, it’s ascent has resulted in a near vertical rise over the last two days as indicated by the white arrow, which shows a Pepe price prediction made three days ago.

That means Pepe is now close to retesting its late-July resistance level of $0.000012.

After a rally this quick, Pepe’s relative strength index (RSI) is falling from 77, which indicates the asset is overbought right now but even if the selling momentum turns into a general sell-off, Pepe is likely to hold its ground at its current level.

You’ve Met Pepe ($PEPE), Now Meet Him Unchained ($PEPU).
The original Pepe is a great blue chip meme coin for many, but a new variation called Pepe Unchained (PEPU) entered presale this summer and has already raised an eye-watering $15.6 million on the simple premise that it’s the first Pepe to run on a proprietary Ethereum Layer 2.

Ethereum is the most commercially important blockchain, but it currently processes about 15 transactions per second (tps) which results in high network congestion and large transaction fees.

To solve this bottleneck, Layer 2 protocols have been created to sit on top of the main Ethereum network and process transactions independently on a side chain, before adding them to the Layer 1 ledger.

One famous Layer 2 is Polygon, represented by the $POL token (formerly $MATIC), which has a maximum recorded 429 tps.

Tokens underlying Layer 2 protocols have collectively amassed a market cap of over $20 billion.

$PEPU is the first meme coin to utilize this technology to give its holders a more enticing value proposition than any standard-issue meme coin.

It’s a hundred times quicker and cheaper to transact with than Ethereum, and thanks to the improved scalability, Pepe Unchained offers $PEPU stakers far greater rewards (currently 136%) than Layer 1 meme coins.
According to the whitepaper, a fifth of the supply of 8 billion $PEPU is for the presale, with a hefty 30% going towards staking.

Another fifth is for the token’s marketing, while the remaining 30% goes equally between DEX liquidity, project development and the Pepe Unchained Layer 2 treasury.
Solana’s biggest doge-themed coin, DogWifHat ($WIF) has advanced 31% on its price last Friday as it trades at $2.35 a token as of this writing.

Its followed closely by Bonk ($BONK), another Solana meme coin, which rose 33% to trade at $0.00002407 at the time of writing.

However, over the course of the last 24 hours, Bonk greatly outpaced DogWifHat.

$WIF rose 6%, and was the only token among the seven largest meme coins by market cap to not post double-digit percentage gains. Bonk rose 16% overnight.

Moo Deng ($MOODENG), a less-than-three-week-old Solana meme coin based on a viral baby pygmy hippo in Thailand of the same name, is up an eye watering 1336% over the last seven days.

Meme coins on Solana collectively rose 17.6% overnight to reach a market cap of $8.99 billion, according to CoinGecko data.
This is broadly in line with today’s meme coin rally, which has added a staggering 22.1% to the now $57.6 billion meme coin market.

In stark contrast, the global crypto market is relatively unmoved, advancing just 1.3% overnight to hit $2.43 trillion.

As usual, market leader Bitcoin ($BTC) set the pace for serious blockchain tokens. Bitcoin added 1% in the last 24 hours and now trades at $66,153.

DogWifHat Price Analysis as WIF Breaks Out
DogWifHat may have posted some relatively conservative overnight gains, but the price chart signals a breakout above the $2 resistance level (red line) that formed after a crypto crash on August 5 bottomed $WIF’s price below $1.30, a low not seen since early March.

The token has strong support (green line) at $1.50 but the falling RSI at 64 indicates some selling is offsetting the buying now to stabilize the price going into the weekend.

Altogether, its clear that DogWifHat has benefited from a meme coin gold rush.

This speculative frenzy is linked to a more optimistic macro-economic outlook, with the US Federal Reserve reducing interest rates for the first time in two years, after hiking them to their highest level in twenty-two years last summer.

After Solana Meme Coins: Solana Casinos
$MOODENG and $DOGWIFHAT are flag bearers of a changing Web3. Solana has made significant inroads into the meme coin sector and now commands a sixth of it, but perhaps the other most exciting sector Solana is entering is GambleFi, which operates at the intersection of two emerging markets: Web3 and online casinos.

And the most exciting upcoming GambleFi project is Mega Dice ($DICE), a crypto casino token that has raked in over $1.9 million so far in its ongoing ICO.

Mega Dice launched last year as the world’s first licensed crypto casino accessible through the popular messaging app Telegram and has since attracted 50,000 players.

Others followed suit and launched iGaming bots on Telegram, most notably TG Casino.

On Friday, meme coins reached a total collective value of $51 billion, as the sector and the broader market aim to close out September – typically the most challenging month for crypto – on a positive note as the market looks ahead to the more favorable months in October and November.

The industry’s first meme coin staking platform, Crypto All-Stars’ MemeVault, designed to amplify recent gains in meme coins, is gaining added momentum from the reawakening of bullish sentiment.

Crypto All-Stars’ presale is on track to reach its next milestone of $1.7 million within hours.

Investors looking to get in on the action have about 24 hours to acquire $STARS at $0.0014652 per token before the price rises to $0.001471, marking the start of the next funding stage.

Top meme coins push for double-digit gains
The extra push in Crypto All-Stars’ funding and the meme coin pump on Friday is largely influenced by top meme coins posting double-digit returns, with trading volumes rising by 56% to nearly $8 billion.
While no specific catalyst can be identified – perhaps aside from the global trend of monetary easing – the sector’s recent positive performance is a much-needed turnaround after nearly two months below the $50 billion market capitalization.

Top tokens such as Dogecoin ($DOGE), Shiba Inu ($SHIB), Bonk ($BONK), Floki ($FLOKI), Brett ($BRETT), DogWifHat ($WIF), and Pepe ($PEPE) saw gains of 11.21%, 19.4%, 17.55%, 16.86%, 15.77%, and 17.46%, respectively.

These increases coincided with a one-day uptick of 5.25% in the MarketVector™ Meme Coin Index, which tracks these top six meme coins.

Other top meme coins, such as MogCoin ($MOG), Milady Meme Coin ($LAYDS), Coq Inu ($COQ), and Turbo ($TURBO), have seen gains of 11.19%, 14.32%, 10.08%, and 3.56%, respectively.

With this bullish momentum returning, the timing is ideal, as the next two months are historically among the best for crypto gains.

However, double-digit returns may still feel modest to seasoned investors, as those entering the crypto space typically seek significantly higher returns.

For example, First Neiro on Ethereum ($NEIRO) exemplifies a crypto Cinderella story, skyrocketing from a $15 million market cap to $468 million in just 11 days – a remarkable 200x return that many crypto investors aspire to achieve.

Projects with such potential usually feature solid tokenomics, robust community support, and, increasingly, added utility – characteristics embodied by Crypto All-Stars.
The $STARS token: The key to substantial capital gains and passive income
Crypto All-Stars is incubating a groundbreaking staking platform called MemeVault, which allows top meme coins to be staked together to earn rewards – the first in the industry to offer such capabilities.

Investors can now amplify returns from meme coins without the hassle of navigating multiple staking pools.

With MemeVault, earning passive income becomes a straightforward and convenient process.

The staking platform supports the aforementioned tokens, excluding $PEPE, as only the original PepeCoin ($PEPECOIN) is included.

However, MemeVault is capable of accommodating an unlimited number of tokens, which could include newer versions of Pepe, such as Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) in the future.

This flexibility emphasizes MemeVault’s efficient, adaptable, and less redundant design.

At this moment, meme coin investing has never been more rewarding, which popular crypto influencer ClayBro can confirm.
MemeVault stakers generate the $STARS token, which is central to maximizing rewards.

The more $STARS tokens held, the greater the opportunity for stakers to earn up to three times the rewards.

This incentive to hold the token serves as a valuable boost, which is why many investors have not only accumulated substantial amounts of $STARS during the presale, but have also staked them in its independent staking protocol for the long term in anticipation of greater rewards at the launch of MemeVault.

At an 888% APY, the returns from staking $STARS are impressive, ranking among the highest in the industry.

However, with a total of 828 million $STARS already staked, that APY is actually a significant drop from 968% when Crypto All-Stars reached the $1.5 million funding milestone.

With strong demand for a presale launched just over a month ago and tokenomics geared for long-term holding, it’s evident that $STARS is the meme coin offering not only potential NEIRO-like gains but also substantial passive income opportunities.
Last Meme Standing: Get ready for 5,000% staking reward
To sweeten the pot, Crypto All-Stars announced a new competition on Tuesday called “Last Meme Standing,” featuring a mouth-watering 5,000% staking reward.
hile the project team has not yet divulged further details on their social media channels, this could be an exciting way for them to give investors a glimpse of what the staking protocol will ultimately offer once launched.

In the meantime, this competition offers participants a great opportunity to boost their returns from their currently bullish meme coin holdings.

Those interested in joining can connect with the Crypto All-Stars community on X and Telegram.

Potential investors can also join early contributors to the project and enjoy high staking rewards before the APY decreases as more investors share the staking rewards.

To participate, visit the Crypto All-Stars website to connect your wallet and exchange ETH, USDT, or BNB for $STARS. The site also accepts bank card payments through a secure and user-friendly interface.

Recently, Crypto All-Stars has started accepting meme coins like $FLOKI, $SHIB, $DOGE, and $PEPE for purchasing $STARS tokens during the presale.

Furthermore, Crypto All-Stars’ smart contract has been fully audited by Coinsult and SolidProof with no issues found regarding its integrity.
Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $66,000 on Friday, following the release of a softer-than-expected US Core PCE inflation report for August.

The news fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve may ease interest rates faster, potentially helping the US economy avoid a recession in 2025.

This marks the highest Bitcoin price in nearly two months.
The headline PCE price index showed US prices rising at a pace of 2.2% year-on-year, down from 2.5% in July and below the expected 2.3% increase.

Month-over-month, the PCE price index rose by 0.1%, which was in line with economists’ expectations.
Meanwhile, the Core PCE price index increased by 2.7% year-on-year, as expected, but the month-over-month rise of 0.1% was slightly below the forecast.

This modest inflation miss led macro traders to price in a higher likelihood of a 50 basis point (bps) interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s upcoming November meeting.

According to the CME Fed Watch Tool, money markets are now pricing in a 53.4% chance of such a rate cut, up from 49.3% the previous day.

Expectations of aggressive monetary easing from the Fed and other major central banks, combined with reduced recession risks, have been a key driver for the Bitcoin price in recent weeks.

Bitcoin price is currently up over 25% from its early September lows of around $52,500 and is set to finish September with a 12% gain.

Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $66,000 on Friday, following the release of a softer-than-expected US Core PCE inflation report for August.

The news fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve may ease interest rates faster, potentially helping the US economy avoid a recession in 2025.

This marks the highest Bitcoin price in nearly two months.


The headline PCE price index showed US prices rising at a pace of 2.2% year-on-year, down from 2.5% in July and below the expected 2.3% increase.

Month-over-month, the PCE price index rose by 0.1%, which was in line with economists’ expectations.


Meanwhile, the Core PCE price index increased by 2.7% year-on-year, as expected, but the month-over-month rise of 0.1% was slightly below the forecast.

This modest inflation miss led macro traders to price in a higher likelihood of a 50 basis point (bps) interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s upcoming November meeting.

According to the CME Fed Watch Tool, money markets are now pricing in a 53.4% chance of such a rate cut, up from 49.3% the previous day.

Expectations of aggressive monetary easing from the Fed and other major central banks, combined with reduced recession risks, have been a key driver for the Bitcoin price in recent weeks.

Bitcoin price is currently up over 25% from its early September lows of around $52,500 and is set to finish September with a 12% gain.

This performance is especially unusual, as September has historically been one of the worst months for Bitcoin price.

In contrast, October is typically a strong month for Bitcoin, with Q4 generally being a period of bullish momentum.

Where Is the Bitcoin Price Headed Next?
Several factors suggest a potential move higher for the Bitcoin price in the coming quarter.

Seasonality, combined with expectations of a global central bank easing cycle, may set the stage for further gains.

The upcoming US Presidential election in November could also play a major role.

With former President Donald Trump, a known supporter of cryptocurrencies, running against Vice President Kamala Harris, who has recently shown a warming attitude toward the sector, market sentiment could swing based on the election results.
While a Trump victory might accelerate the crypto rally, Harris is not viewed as a negative factor for Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry.

Historical patterns also suggest that the post-halving cycle, which typically leads to significant Bitcoin rallies, will play a role.

According to some analysts, Bitcoin rallies usually intensify about 170 days after the halving event, with market peaks occurring 480 days later.

Though the recent surge in Bitcoin price, driven by strong demand for Bitcoin ETFs, may mean this cycle won’t match previous rallies in intensity, signs still point toward a bullish end to 2024.

Potential Targets and ETF Impact
Institutional demand for Bitcoin via ETFs has increased noticeably in recent sessions, and this trend is expected to continue in the weeks ahead.

Many analysts believe this will become a major talking point in the market, driving further attention to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin bulls are eyeing a retest of key resistance levels, starting at $70,000, followed by a potential attempt to break the all-time highs near $74,000.
If the historical bullish trend for October continues, a breakout to fresh record highs may occur next month.

Some are speculating that Bitcoin could again aim for the $100,000 mark in the near future.

A combination of easing inflation, favorable Federal Reserve actions, upcoming political events, and historical patterns point to the potential for further upside in the Bitcoin price as we move into the final quarter of the year.
Bitcoin is extending its upward rally, surpassing the $66,000 mark on Friday and reaching an intra-day high of $66,200. The surge coincides with the global crypto market cap climbing to $2.29 trillion, reflecting a 24-hour gain of around 2%.

This recent spike is fueled by optimism surrounding the U.S. economy’s potential for a ‘soft landing’ on inflation, bolstered by favorable macroeconomic data. Renewed interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs and rising institutional buying, driven by China’s and the U.S.

Federal Reserve’s rate cuts, is further propelling Bitcoin’s momentum and pushing it to a two-month high. All eyes are now on BTC’s next move.

US Inflation Data Supports Crypto Market Growth
The latest U.S. inflation data has fueled optimism in the crypto market. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index showed an annual rate of 2.2%, slightly below the expected 2.3% and down from 2.5% last month, signaling easing inflation pressures.

The Core PCE Price Index, excluding food and energy, held steady at 2.7%. These numbers suggest the Federal Reserve’s efforts to control inflation are paying off.
As a result, Bitcoin climbed to $66,200, and Ethereum rose above $2,660, reflecting renewed investor confidence. Continued declines in inflation could prompt the Fed to maintain or even accelerate rate cuts, supporting further crypto gains.

Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge Amid $66K Price Spike and Fed Rate Cut
Bitcoin’s recent climb above $66,000 has triggered significant inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, with $365.6 million added on September 26 alone — the largest since July. This increase marks six consecutive days of inflows, highlighting growing institutional interest in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s recent climb above $66,000 has triggered significant inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, with $365.6 million added on September 26 alone — the largest since July. This increase marks six consecutive days of inflows, highlighting growing institutional interest in Bitcoin.


ARK 21Shares’ ARKB ETF led the charge, securing $113.8 million, followed by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) with $93.4 million.

Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and Bitwise’s BITB also saw robust inflows of $74 million and $50.4 million, respectively.
However, Grayscale’s GBTC, which recently converted to a spot ETF, saw an outflow of $7.7 million.

Since their inception, these ETFs have attracted $18.3 billion, driven by Bitcoin’s rally and the Fed’s recent rate cuts, which have boosted investor confidence in crypto-linked funds.

$7.7 Billion Bitcoin and Ethereum Options Expiry Sparks Market Volatility
The crypto market is bracing for heightened volatility as over $7.7 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options are set to expire today. Early trading saw increased price fluctuations, particularly during the Indian market hours.
Bitcoin’s open interest stands at 89,005 options, with more than 60% being call options. The total notional value of these Bitcoin options is $5.82 billion, with a max pain price of $59,000, indicating potential price swings during U.S. trading hours.

Similarly, Ethereum faces a $1.91 billion options expiry, with 716,917 open contracts and a max pain price of $2,550.

The combined expiries could trigger significant market movement as traders reposition to manage losses and gains following the recent surge in Bitcoin prices past $65,000.

Daily Technical Outlook: Bitcoin (BTC/USD) – September 27, 2024
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading at $66,285, maintaining a bullish trend within an ascending channel pattern. The cryptocurrency has broken above the key pivot point of $65,680, indicating sustained upward momentum.

Immediate resistance is observed at $66,539, followed by $67,152 and $67,564. If Bitcoin continues to gain, these levels could be tested.

Conversely, support is set at $65,680, with lower levels at $64,747 and $64,265 providing strong backing.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 70.95, signaling that Bitcoin is entering overbought territory, which could prompt short-term profit-taking.

The 50-day EMA at $64,265 serves as a crucial support level, supporting the ongoing bullish outlook.

Key Insights:

Immediate Resistance: $66,539 – A break above could lead to further gains.
Support: $65,680 – Holding above this level is key for continued bullish momentum.
Overbought RSI: 70.95 suggests potential for short-term consolidation.
In conclusion, Bitcoin’s technical indicators hint at a positive outlook, but overbought conditions could trigger minor corrections before another rally

Cryptonews Podcast host Matt Zahab recently sat down for an exclusive chat with Pratik Gauri, the founder and CEO of 5ire, a fifth-generation blockchain ecosystem, built from the ground up with the United Nations (UN)’s sustainable development goals in mind.

Gauri discussed the intersection of profit and purpose, the concept of earning more money by benefiting the world, and how 5ire enables this.

He talked about the novel sustainable proof-of-stake model, its profitable ESG-as-a-service model, and the major (past and upcoming) milestones on the project’s path.

Earning Money by Doing Good
Gauri had built eight companies before 5ire. His goal has always been to impact a billion people positively, he told Matt.

After exiting the last company, he identified his niche – the Fifth Industrial Revolution.

This is when he realized he wanted to work at the intersection of profit and purpose, or money and impact.
Gauri wanted to “prove that people can make money while doing good.” Actually, the more good they do, the more money they make, he said.

Therefore, 5ire was his entry into the cryptocurrency/blockchain/Web3 space.

“I was motivated by how you can impact a billion people, but not through philanthropy because I wasn’t rich,” he said.

Gauri doesn’t even believe in that concept – he finds it unsustainable.

Earning Money by Doing Good
Gauri had built eight companies before 5ire. His goal has always been to impact a billion people positively, he told Matt.

After exiting the last company, he identified his niche – the Fifth Industrial Revolution.

This is when he realized he wanted to work at the intersection of profit and purpose, or money and impact.


Gauri wanted to “prove that people can make money while doing good.” Actually, the more good they do, the more money they make, he said.

Therefore, 5ire was his entry into the cryptocurrency/blockchain/Web3 space.

“I was motivated by how you can impact a billion people, but not through philanthropy because I wasn’t rich,” he said.

Gauri doesn’t even believe in that concept – he finds it unsustainable.


The concept he does believe in is empowering people so that they make more money than they’re currently making.

Million empowered people doing well will empower ten million more, which will continue to spread exponentially.

Through the process of building the eight companies, Gauri realized that integrating blockchain and crypto would expedite the progress and give power back to the community.

It is capable of providing a tool for financial inclusion and monetary improvement.

“This is where the banking is going to go. This is where the data storage is going to go,” Gauri remarked.
Never Done Before: Sustainable L1
The 5ire team decided to invent something never seen before, Gauri told Matt. They created a sustainable proof-of-stake model, embedding sustainability into the Layer-1 infrastructure itself.

It works to reward and incentivize sustainable practices from the core of the blockchain.

This is basically a nominated proof-of-stake (NPOS) with an ESG layer stacked on top.
The validator using more sustainable options receives more points, hence higher chances to validate the block and make more money.

“If you’re sustainable, you end up making more money in the whole ecosystem of 5ire versus if you’re in some other ecosystem,” said Gauri.

In a typical proof-of-stake, the rich get to validate the blocks and get richer, and the poor keep going poor. It’s very hard to bridge that gap, Gauri argues.

Therefore, 5ire came up with this sustainable proof-of-stake to “give an element to sustainable behavior.”

The team gives weightage to both NPOS and ESG.

“And now that weighted average helps incentivize sustainable behavior from bottoms up,” the CEO explained.

The model also includes a “unique” ESG score.

In fact, its ESG-as-a-service is a big revenue model for the project. Per Gauri, it is already working well with institutional clients and some Fortune 500 companies in the UAE and other countries.

In fact, its ESG-as-a-service is a big revenue model for the project. Per Gauri, it is already working well with institutional clients and some Fortune 500 companies in the UAE and other countries.

The Journey Has Just Begun
However, blockchain is not cheap. Building a good product takes time, money, and a large team of technical engineers.

Building a blockchain comes with a set of challenges.

For example, 5ire had to scrape their blockchain two times before the final version was ready.

Also, finding and retaining good talent is very difficult.

Additionally, there’s the challenge of raising money.

However, 5ire’s idea “resonated with a lot of early investors.” About 250 investors invested between $100,000 and $200,000 each.

The team hit the goal and started building the technology. Then an investor on the equity side wanted to invest $100 million on a $1.5 billion valuation, which gave them a unicorn status.

The team, however, returned the money, saying they didn’t need as much. Once they’ve listed the token, they would make money. Additionally, they’d collect gas fees once the mainnet goes live.
In December 2023, the team did the IEO on Bybit, followed by listings on other exchanges. “We’re going to do some more listings now in this bull market,” Gauri said.

When it comes to the mainnet, 5ire has made some key partnerships, including the Indian government and a state government in the United States.
They’ve also accomplished milestones on institutional adoption and retail sides, the CEO says.

Additionally, more than 200 dapps are going to be building on 5ire, “so I think the journey has just begun for us.”

Hopefully, he added, the entire crypto market will go from $2.5 trillion to $5-6 trillion. 5ire would get good liquidity for dapps, which would give them a high total value locked (TVL).

And the message remains the same, he says. “You can actually make money while you do good. Even if you have something built on sustainability around environment, friendly stuff, you can still make money.”

What is Next for 5ire?
As for what awaits the project in the near future, Gauri noted that the token is listed on four exchanges and will get further listings in the next few months.

Next, the team is working on adoption and getting good projects. The biggest focus is AI and RWA.
The third biggest focus is the native DEX. “We’ve been building it for a long while now, and we are launching it very soon,” Gauri said.

Additionally, the team is working on “a funny meme launchpad.”

Lastly, the project offers a large, $10-million grant program, while the next one will rise to $25 million.
Bitcoin’s bullish break above $65K has ignited FOMO in the altcoin market as altseason anticipation rises, according to 10x Research CEO Markus Thielen.

In a September 26th 10x market update, Thielen maintained a bullish outlook for altcoins, citing Bitcoin’s recent break above the stubborn resistance threshold at $65,000 as a prelude to the “next wave.”

Thielen opined that Bitcoin’s breakout above $65,000 has “fuelled” FOMO returning to the altcoin market. “A major surge could be on the horizon, sparking even more FOMO across the crypto space,” he added.

A scenario he forecasts to unfold quickly, setting a Bitcoin target of $70,000 in the next two weeks, with “all-time highs by late October.”

This focus on altcoins is underscored by notable shifts in market dynamics. Bitcoin’s dominance has waned, down 1.57% to 57.51%, according to TradingView data. Meanwhile, Ethereum gas fees have spiked, fueled by a surge in altcoin activity across the ecosystem.

nalysts have interpreted this as a sign that Bitcoin’s dominance is peaking. Investors appear to be selling BTC and rotating their capital into alternative coins, indicating that “altcoins are likely the focus for now.”

What’s Pushing the ‘Next Wave’ For Altcoins?
Thielen suggested that if the US Federal Reserve “remains open to cutting rates,” high-beta altcoins will likely gain further momentum.
His comments come shortly after the Fed’s September 18th decision to cut rates by 50 basis points, a bullish indicator for riskier assets. Declining interest rates make traditional investments like bonds and term deposits less appealing to investors.

Something made credible by the Fed’s dovish dot plot, which showed that the median Fed policymaker expects a further 150 basis points in rate cuts by the end of 2025.

Meanwhile, retail crypto trading activity in South Korea supports this trend, with daily trading volumes now hovering around $2 billion. Shiba Inu has reclaimed the top spot in trading volume in South Korea, signaling “rising speculation and setting the stage for a potential Q4 rally.”

The recently announced People’s Bank of China (PBOC) stimulus package also sets grounds for optimism. Timed just as the Fed begins cutting rates, it could trigger significant capital outflows from China into the cryptocurrency market.

Thielen speculated that the $278 billion Chinese stimulus plan could “ignite a parabolic rally in cryptocurrency prices, fueled by increasing global liquidity.”

In 2013, Chinese exporters used over-invoicing to funnel billions into Bitcoin, triggering a massive rally—a scenario Thielen can see recurring.
Altseason Isn’t Here Yet, According to Metrics
The analyst summarized his analysis by saying “the likelihood of a Q4 rally is exceptionally high” as catalysts continue to stack in the market’s favor, particularly for altcoins—something analysts have cited with the potential to spark the “biggest” altseason since 2017.

However, it’s not yet time to celebrate, as the altcoin season index by Blockchain Center indicates that “it is not altcoin season.” According to this index, it is considered altcoin season if 75% of the top 50 coins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days.

This score is steadily increasing, though. Currently, 41% of the top 50 coins have outperformed Bitcoin, approaching a recovery of the levels seen immediately after the Fed rate cut, which peaked at 46%.

Therefore, while optimism is high and catalysts are aligning, caution remains as the market waits for a more decisive shift in altcoin performance.

Meanwhile, we remain in an accumulation zone as we approach this critical juncture. This presents a valuable opportunity for investors to reaffirm their positions in the most promising altcoins leading into the anticipated altseason.

Wall Street’s Guggenheim Treasury Tokenizes $20 Million Paper on Ethereum
In crypto news today, Guggenheim Treasury Services, a subsidiary of Wall Street giant Guggenheim Capital, has issued the first Ethereum-based Digital Commercial Paper (DCP) through AmpFi.Digital, a blockchain platform for the issuance, trading, and governance of digital assets.

According to the press release, $20 million was issued at launch.


AmpFi.Digital is developed by Zeconomy, which aims to enhance the value, utility, and returns of traditional financial products through blockchain technology, the team said.

Its CEO Giacinto Cosenza said that there are now tens of billions of dollars locked in DeFi and corporate treasuries. The partnership with GTS will address the need for more trusted and secure blockchain solutions.

“As clearly demonstrated by the ETFs approval and the growth of the tokenization space,” said Cosenza, “there is a massive demand for these digital assets, and we want to enable our partners so they can be at the forefront of what could be a transformative moment in the financial industry.”

Tokenized Government Securities recently surpassed $2 billion in market capitalization, the announcement added.
On its part, AmpFi.Digital provides asset-backed, rated digital assets built on stable instruments like T-bills and commercial paper.

These can be “transformed into new utility, higher returns, and unique opportunities for issuers, DeFi platforms, and corporate investors,” it said.Bitdeer Completes Testing of Its Latest SEAL02 Bitcoin Mining Chip
Major crypto mining company Bitdeer announced the successful testing of its latest Bitcoin mining chip, SEAL02.

Per the press release, SEAL02 will be integrated into the company’s upcoming SEALMINER A2 mining machines.

Mass production is scheduled to start in November.

In partnership with semiconductor foundry TSMC, SEAL02 uses “one of the most advanced process nodes.”
Additionally, it has achieved the power efficiency milestone outlined in the technology roadmap, which was announced in June this year.

Testing the chip, the team recorded power efficiency ratio of 13.5 J/TH, while running at low voltage, ultra-power-saving mode.

Linghui Kong, Chief Business Officer of Bitdeer, said that the company is “thrilled about achieving SEALMINER’s power efficiency target as reflected in our roadmap.”

“Our ongoing commitment to R&D is making possible innovative and superior solutions that will set new benchmarks for efficiency and transparency to benefit the wider mining ecosystem,” Kong added.

Meanwhile, the R&D team continues their work on the upcoming chip, SEAL03. The company’s product release milestone is on track, the announcement said.
In other crypto news today, ENS Labs, the organization behind the domain naming system Ethereum Name Service (ENS), is integrating with Arianee, a provider of open and interoperable digital product passports.

The press release says that the collaboration will enable brands to secure their on-chain identities and authenticate all digital interactions, from ownership verification to customer engagement.

The companies using the Arianee Protocol previously utilized its Verified Issuer feature and committee validation. A Know-Your-Business (KYB) process was required to verify NFT authorship.

However, thanks to the partnership with ENS, brands can directly link their corporate domain names and public wallet addresses to their ENS names.

This helps brands streamline the verification process and create a “robust, verifiable” identity on Ethereum, allowing them to authenticate all NFT-based digital product passports tied to the brand.

Here’s How the New UK Crypto Law Improves Legal Clarity and Benefits Kraken Traders

Disclaimer: The text below is an advertorial article that is not part of Cryptonews.com editorial content. While it has undergone editorial review to ensure quality and relevance, it may not reflect the views of Cryptonews.com and is clearly distinguished from our independent editorial content.


In a pivotal moment for the crypto industry, the UK Parliament has introduced the Property (Digital Assets etc) Bill, a piece of legislation designed to clarify the legal status of digital assets like cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and carbon credits.

This is a third category of “thing” – aside from “things in possession” (e.g. gold and money) and “things in action” (e.g. debts, shares) – that allows these digital assets to attract personal property rights.

What Does the New Bill Mean for UK Crypto Investors?
The introduction of this bill has major implications for crypto investors in the UK. One of the most significant outcomes is the increased legal protection it provides against fraud and scams. By recognizing crypto tokens as personal property, the new law can also help judges deal with cases where such assets are disputed or form part of settlements, for example in divorce cases.

For UK traders and businesses, this is especially important in complex crypto-related cases. Whether it’s disputes over ownership, theft of crypto tokens, or complications surrounding inheritance, the bill provides a robust legal foundation to address these issues.

Source: Law Commission, Digital Assets
Summary of final report
This will likely enhance confidence in the crypto market, as investors can now rest assured that their holdings are backed by the same legal protections as other forms of personal property. For institutional players, it offers clarity and legitimacy, making it easier to engage in the crypto markets without navigating legal grey areas.

Moreover, the new law can potentially drive innovation as businesses and startups find themselves in a more predictable and legally sound environment, encouraging further investment in the UK’s burgeoning crypto space.

How Does Kraken Benefit from the New UK Crypto Law?
Kraken, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, stands to benefit significantly from this new bill as Kraken has always prided itself on its strong regulatory stance. Currently, Kraken holds registrations, licenses, authorizations, and approvals in countries and regions like the US, Canada, the UK, the EU, Australia, and the Middle East.
As the bill provides clearer legal protections, more traders—particularly those hesitant due to previous uncertainties—are likely to choose Kraken for its secure and compliant environment.

For more clarity on Kraken’s compliance, users can contact Kraken’s support, which is available 24/7 via email or chat.

Kraken’s Standout Features for UK Traders
One of Kraken’s core strengths is its industry-leading security and compliance measures. From regular audits to its proof of reserves protocol, Kraken ensures that its users’ assets are safeguarded at all times. It’s no wonder that over 10 million clients from over 190 countries have chosen Kraken as their main crypto exchange.

Users can seamlessly buy and sell over 200 cryptocurrencies by connecting a funding method, including a card, digital wallet, FPS, CHAPS, and BACS for their GBP. Other currencies and international payments are supported, too, for those living abroad.
Kraken offers an industry-leading mobile app for its traders, as well as desktop and web applications for beginners and professionals. There are futures and margin trading features for those who want to use leverage. Conservative investors who want to grow their investments with minimal risk can lock their cryptocurrencies to earn an annual percentage rate that varies depending on the cryptocurrency they select.

Kraken also offers 24/7 customer support, which is essential in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading. Whether it’s assistance with trades, funding issues, or account security, Kraken’s support team is always available to provide guidance.

What’s Our Verdict of the New UK Crypto Bill?
The new Property (Digital Assets, etc) Bill marks a significant milestone in the UK’s journey toward becoming a global leader in cryptoassets. By defining cryptocurrencies and NFTs as personal property in a category called “things,” the bill marks a crucial development for both retail and institutional traders, as it ensures that their digital assets are protected under UK law, reducing the risk of fraud and providing a clear legal framework for disputes.

For platforms like Kraken that have been around since 2011, this new legal landscape presents a golden opportunity to solidify their position in the market. Kraken’s strong regulatory compliance, coupled with its robust security measures, makes it a natural beneficiary of the new law.
Over the past 24 hours, the XRP price has held steady after some slight fluctuations, up 0.08%.

Meanwhile, a transaction placing XRP at a valuation of $1,000 per coin has left investors stumped.

This lacklustre price action continues from last Friday, with XRP up a mere 0.25%.

Although it has made some progress, it has markedly underperformed compared to the rapid growth seen in other notable altcoins over the same period.

Despite this largely negligible price action, more eyes are on XRP. The altcoin’s trading volume has surged by 19.03% to $1.236 billion over the past 24 hours.

Will the Transaction Push XRP to $1,000?
The September 26th transaction set an RLUSD rate that would place XRP at around $1,000 a piece, according to XRPscan.

XRP Price Reaches $1,000 in Puzzling Exchange Transaction – What's Going On?
Over the past 24 hours, the XRP price has held steady after some slight fluctuations, up 0.08%.

Meanwhile, a transaction placing XRP at a valuation of $1,000 per coin has left investors stumped.

This lacklustre price action continues from last Friday, with XRP up a mere 0.25%.

This coveted valuation sent traders into a frenzy, speculating that Ripple’s stablecoin would propel XRP to $1,000.

However, this quickly proved unfounded as the transaction was revealed to be a decentralized exchange (DEX) offer.
Pseudonymous XRP Validator Val provided commentary on X, clarifying that the transaction was “just a DEX offer. Anyone can offer those, and no one in their right mind would sell 6,000 RLUSD for 6 XRP.”

Pseudonymous XRP Validator Val provided commentary on X, clarifying that the transaction was “just a DEX offer. Anyone can offer those, and no one in their right mind would sell 6,000 RLUSD for 6 XRP.”


In DEXs, users can place a limit order specifying the price at which they are willing to buy or sell a particular cryptocurrency in a peer-to-peer transaction.

Such trades do not reflect the actual value of the cryptocurrency. “RLUSD will not put XRP at $1,000, folks,” Val Summarised.

XRP Price is Not Going to $1,000, But How Far Can It Go?
While disappointing, this is not to discredit the stablecoin’s potential to push the XRP price.

RLUSD won’t boost XRP directly, but it will help bring users into the wider Ripple ecosystem, which could have long-term advantages for the coin’s price.

A factor that factor that contributes to an increasingly bullish outlook for XRP, in favour of an upward breakout from the 4-year symmetrical triangle pattern.
Most significantly, it seems that XRP has found comfort in its new bullish lean, as its Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains firm in its position above the neutral line, currently at 55.

Although this is neutral, it exhibits a strong bias towards buying pressure.

This sentiment is mirrored by the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which is gradually moving away from negative territory week on week. It is now at -0.057, just half of what it was at the start of the month.

Meanwhile, as the MACD line reaffirms a comfortable lead above the Signal line, it seems that bulls are in control, making a breakout in the near term credible.

For the XRP price to continue its upward trajectory, it must break the $0.60 level and reclaim the 200 SMA as support.

A clean break above these levels would signal the potential for a larger rally and a shift in market sentiment.

The extent of such a move could trigger a 225% rally in the coming months, reclaiming the past high of $1.97.
However, with fundamental catalysts stacking up in favour of an altseason, the potential for even further growth is considerable.

This New Opportunity Has Higher Gains Potential
Although a $2 XRP is certainly an appealing prospect, emerging opportunities hold the potential for truly substantial gains.

Strategic investors may find an advantage in diversifying into newer low-cap meme coins that have the potential to rally exponentially.

Specifically, Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) presents a unique opportunity by pioneering the industry’s first meme coin staking platform.

The MemeVault brings together the entire meme coin community under the Crypto All-Stars umbrella, staking to earn rewards in the project’s native token, $STARS.

This allows the most dedicated meme coin holders to stay true to their favorite coins while capitalizing on the gains staking offers. Something which may be credited to its instant success, raising over $1.6 million in its presale already!
This confidence is bolstered by STARS’s commitment to transparency, with two successful audits ensuring investor safety.

Beyond its pioneering approach to meme coin staking, $STARS itself offers one of the biggest passive income opportunities right now, with a lucrative 887% APY. While the market wanes amidst recent volatility, All-Star investors are raking in consistent gains!

Shiba Inu has jumped by 14% in the past 24 hours, with the SHIB price moving to $0.00001958 on a day when the market as a whole has gained by only 1%.

SHIB is now up by 35% in a week and by 39% in the past month, with the meme token also sitting on a healthy 170% increase in the past year.

This makes it one of the best-performing major meme tokens in the market this year, with its recent jumps coming as its burn rate surges.

And with over 400 trillion SHIB burned to date (and counting), the relative reduction in the coin’s supply is likely to keep pushing up its price over time.

Can Shiba Inu’s Surge Make Millionaires in 2024? SHIB Price Analysis
According to data from Shibburn, Shiba Inu’s burn rate has actually increased by a whopping 33,818% in the past 24 hours.

To an extent this comes from rising Shibarium usage, with daily transactions more than doubling in the past week.
This excitement has clearly fed into the SHIB price, with the coin’s chart signalling lots of momentum today.

For instance, its relative strength index (purple) has been above 70 and nearing 80 for well over a day now.

Its 30-period moving average (orange) is also climbing further above the 200-period average (blue), indicating that SHIB has entered a new expansionary phase.
What’s especially encouraging is that SHIB’s trading volume has exploded in the past few days, and has passed $2 billion today.

It’s arguable that such an increase was overdue, with SHIB having underperformed for much of 2024.

This means that the coin has lots of catching up to do, and could continue rising steadily throughout the end of the year.

The SHIB price may hit $0.000020 over the weekend and then $0.000030 by the end of November.
New Meme Tokens with Fundamentals
SHIB looks to be hotting up, but there’s always a risk with strongly bought tokens that they may correct.

However, there are alternative options that look very good at the moment, with presale coins being one profitable outlet for traders.

One of the newest and most exciting presale coins around at the moment is Memebet Token (MEMEBET), an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has raised $300,000 since opening its offering a couple of weeks ago.
Memebet is exciting because its token will serve as the utility coin for its very own online crypto-friendly casino, which it will launch once the presale concludes.

Its platform will offer over 1,000 crypto-native games to play, from virtual slots and table games to a big sportsbook.

Users will be able to place bets with the native MEMEBET token, as well as with established coins such as Pepe, Dogecoin, Bonk and Shiba Inu.

Playing with MEMEBET puts users in line for extra play-to-earn rewards, with 20% of the coin’s 2 billion MEMEBET supply being reserved for payouts.

Memebet will also be offering a KYC-free Telegram casino, making it a highly accessible platform for gamers around the world.

Interested investors can join its sale now by going to the official Memebet Token website and connecting their software wallets.

1 MEMEBET currently costs $0.0254, with this price rising by $0.001 with every new stage of the sale.
Covalent is excited to announce the launch of its Ethereum Wayback Machine (EWM) Light Client Testnet, a key initiative designed to protect Ethereum’s decentralized and trustless nature as it continues to scale. The light client allows participants to help secure Ethereum’s historical data, ensuring long-term availability without relying on centralized entities.

The Cardano price has risen by 2.5% in the past 24 hours, moving to $0.4055 as the crypto market as a whole gains by 2% today.

This means that ADA has gained by 13% in a week and by 16% in a month, with the coin in the market also seeing a 66% rise in the past year.

These gains mark a promising period for Cardano, which has now become the tenth-biggest coin in the market, flipping Tron this morning.

Given its recent momentum, and given ongoing Cardano updates, we could certainly see the alt climb higher and flip other coins.

Cardano Price Forecast as ADA Enters Top 10 – Will It Overtake Solana?
ADA has been riding some strong momentum this week, which would imply that we may see a little dip this weekend before it continues its medium- and long-term growth.

For example, its relative strength index (purple) has declined from a high 70 early this morning to just over 50, suggesting that some traders may be taking profits today.
This is happening amid a 30-period moving average (period) that has been well above the 200-period average (blue) for more than a week, its distance also suggesting that a little correction is due very soon.


Yet the fact that ADA has hit its highest volume for a month today (at just over $460 million) would suggest that any correction will be brief, with the alt having lots of impetus right now.

Some traders have noted that its current pattern is uncannily close to replicating the movements of its 2019 rally, which would imply very strong gains in the coming months.

It helps that Cardano is boasting increasingly strong fundamentals, with the network continuing work on scaling updates.

The biggest update on its horizon is Leios, which will founder Charles Hoskinson recently declared will make Cardano “faster than Solana but without losing decentralization.”
evelopers expect it to launch in the first half of next year, but it’s likely that the Cardano price will have already posted considerable gains by then.

This will partly be because the wider market is now gaining stream, following the Fed’s interest rate reduction earlier this month.

We may therefore witness a strong end to the year, with Cardano potentially reaching $0.50 by the end of October and $1 by the New Year.

New Small-Cap Alts with Big Potential
While ADA could rocket in the not-too distant future, most traders would do well to allocate a percentage of their portfolios to newer tokens, since the best of these can often rise exponentially.

This can also be the case with presale coins, which in generating momentum during their sales then go on to rally when listing.

One coin with a great chance of doing this is layer-two project Pepe Unchained (PEPU), which has now raised over $15.6 million in its hugely successful sale.
Pepe Unchained is close to launching its L2 network for Ethereum, with its platform offering near-instant transactions and very low fees.

Its long-term goal is to become an ecosystem for meme tokens, potentially attracting usage away from existing L2s such as Base and Optimism, as well as from Solana.

One incentive to joining its network is that, because of its greater scalability, it will offer double the staking rewards it would have as a layer-one meme coin running directly on Ethereum.

This could result in considerable demand for PEPU, which will also be necessary to pay for the network’s transaction fees.

It will come with a max supply of 8 billion PEPU, with its protocol allocating 30% to staking and 20% to its presale.

It’s also bullish that it now has a rapidly growing community, with its official X account boasting over 19,000 followers.
Investors can join PEPU’s sale at the coin’s official website, where it’s now selling at $0.00986 per token.

This price will rise tomorrow, while it could rocket once the sale ends and PEPU lists on exchanges.
CZ’s release date has been moved from Sunday, September 29, to Friday, September 27, per a Fortune report. The release was moved up because prisons don’t free inmates on weekends, per a rule under the US Code Title 18.

“If the date for a prisoner’s release falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday at the place of confinement, the prisoner may be released by the Bureau on the last preceding weekday,” the law read.

CZ, who spent his initial couple of months of charges at a California desert prison, later moved to a halfway house in Long Beach.

In May, a Seattle court ordered CZ to serve a four-month jail sentence. The charges followed his guilty plea to money laundering violations last year.
rison officials report that after moving to a halfway house in Long Beach, he received supervised excursions and even went to the movies.

With his release, Zhao will likely get a chauffeured car and be taken to a private jet in Long Beach or Los Angeles. A Binance spokesperson noted that he might also visit Dubai or Paris to meet his family.

CZ’s counsel told Fortune that he does not intend to be interviewed on the day of his release. He has served 116 days in prison if he were to be freed on Friday.

Would CZ Plan a Comeback?
Zhao would face a complex landscape upon his release, mainly because the crypto industry is under intense regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, Binance itself continues to grapple with legal challenges.

Before his jail term, he spent the past five months traveling across the US, networking with other entrepreneurs. Per a report from the New York Times, he even chatted about potential start-up plans with OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman.

CZ has been laying the ground for his future after his release. In March, Zhao announced his next project – Giggle Academy – a new online educational project, which isn’t related to crypto.

He also previously expressed interest in investing in artificial intelligence and biotechnology, and has corresponded with other executives, NYT reported.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Pushes Above $66K After Soft US Inflation - Here’s Where Its Headed Next
1 day ago
A crypto investor has turned a $1,300 investment into a staggering $3.4 million in just two weeks by betting on the hippo-themed Moo Deng (MOODENG) token.

The story first came to light after on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain identified the trader’s activity on the Solana blockchain.

According to data from blockchain explorer Solscan, the investor initially spent 9.8 Solana, worth approximately $1,331 at the time, to purchase 38.7 million MOODENG tokens on September 10.

$1K Investment Turns Into $3.4 Million
In the following two weeks, the value of the Moo Deng token soared exponentially, transforming the modest investment into a $3.4 million fortune.

While this incredible return captured the attention of the crypto community, it also raised questions about the legitimacy of the gain.

Critics pointed out that the MOODENG liquidity pool holds only $1.8 million, making it nearly impossible for the investor to cash out the entire amount at the current market price without significantly impacting the token’s value.
Nevertheless, this incident is not an isolated case.

On September 26, Lookonchain reported another instance where a trader turned a $95 investment in INCEPT tokens into $96,900 within just 12 hours.

The analytics firm noted that most of the wallet addresses that recently made such high returns on INCEPT investments appeared to be “insider wallets,” further raising concerns about potential market manipulation.
In another instance, an investor netted $131.72 million from investing in Ether during the 2022 bear market.

This investor purchased 96,639 ETH from Coinbase in early September 2022, when Ether was trading around $1,567, and held on through market fluctuations for two years.

Crypto Market Rallies Amid Bullish Sentiment
The crypto market has surged amid a broader bullish sentiment across global risk markets.

“It’s all green lights for global risk markets as U.S. equities hit new all-time highs for the third time this week,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SOFA.org.

“The rally has been fueled by rapid stimulus measures to revive the struggling Chinese economy, which has led renowned macro observers to turn explicitly bullish on all risk assets in the interim. The synchronized global easing move is reminiscent of the easy-money days of the QE era.”

Over the past day, Bitcoin’s price climbed 2.9% to $65,330.96, its highest level since late July.
n a recent interview, SEC Chair Gary Gensler emphasizes the critical need for trust and investor protection in the crypto industry, stating it will not persist without them.In a recent interview with CNBC, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler reiterated the critical need for trust in the cryptocurrency industry, drawing parallels between crypto and historical innovations like the automobile.

He emphasized that innovation, while essential, can only flourish with trust and transparency. By referencing the SEC’s role as the “cops on the beat,” he illustrated the importance of regulatory bodies in ensuring market safety.

Additionally, he stressed on the idea that the field could sustain itself without strict rules and proper oversight.

Gensler Call for Trust: “Crypto Will Not Survive Without Trust”
Gensler noted that the SEC’s enforcement actions against various crypto firms are intended to create a safe environment for investors.

These actions have targeted some of the industry’s most prominent figures, such as Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and others. Many of them are now facing jail time or substantial financial penalties.

He pointed out, saying:Gensler reiterated the importance of investor protection, referring to the numerous bankruptcies and billions of dollars lost in the space.


He criticized by pointing out the long-term consequences of allowing fraudulent practices to go unchecked.

Gensler also reiterated his belief in the cryptocurrency industry’s need for clear rules and investor protections, stressing that no field can thrive without building trust.

“This field will not long survive if you can’t build that investor trust in the markets,”

Referring to Bitcoin Whitepaper’s 16th anniversary, he acknowledged its innovation but warned that, like any other industry, crypto requires a regulatory framework to ensure it operates safely.

Gensler argued that while crypto is a small part of the global capital markets, making up less than 1%, investor protection is crucial to fostering innovation in the space.
itcoin’s Status: Still Not a Security
During the conversation, Gensler reaffirmed the SEC’s long-standing position that Bitcoin is not classified as a security.

He cited the Howey Test, which is used to determine if an asset qualifies as a security.

Under the Howey Test, an asset is a security if it involves an investment of money in a common enterprise, with the expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others.

Since Bitcoin operates more like a decentralized commodity, such as gold, it does not fit the criteria to be regulated as a security.

Stressing more on that, Gensler said:
“You can decide to go long or short these projects, but you need the disclosures.”

He also highlighted that he and his predecessor had consistently maintained that Bitcoin is not a security under the SEC’s purview.

This distinction sets Bitcoin apart from many other cryptocurrencies, which have been criticized by regulators for raising funds through unregistered securities offerings.

Notably, during the talk, Gensler addressed the broader concerns about unclear regulations in the crypto sector. He pushed back on claims that there’s regulatory ambiguity, noting,

“Not liking the rules is not the same as there aren’t rules.”

He maintained that the SEC’s role is to protect investors from the conflicts of interest and fraud that have plagued the industry.

Gensler’s tenure at the SEC has been marked by an aggressive stance against the crypto industry. The agency has taken legal action against major players like Ripple Labs.
Are you wondering if Hamster Kombat’s innovative play-to-earn gaming model, launching on September 26, 2024, is a worthy investment? Another exciting project, Rexas Finance (RXS), is gaining attention for its potential to revolutionize real-world asset tokenization. This article explores the unique use cases of both projects in 2024.

Hamster Kombat
Hamster Kombat is a play-to-earn (P2E) blockchain-based game that combines NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi). Players run a crypto exchange using their NFT hamsters, earning rewards through battles and tournaments. The project encourages community involvement, allowing users to trade and upgrade NFTs seamlessly.

With a unique focus on gamified DeFi and NFT utilities, Hamster Kombat aims to create an immersive gaming ecosystem while rewarding users through various in-game achievements and token-based incentives.

Hamster Kombat’s Key Features
Meme Coin Appeal: Like other meme cryptocurrencies, Hamster Kombat caters to a target audience of meme degens and those looking for viral tokens.
P2E Gaming Potential: The emergence of P2E games in the crypto domain has demonstrated a breadth of opportunities for users and the emerging industry.
Early-Stage Investment: As with any presale, early-bird investors stand to generate potential ROIs.
Rexas Finance (RXS)
Rexas Finance (RXS) is a new RWA (Real-World Asset) tokenization platform that brings liquidity to traditionally illiquid markets. The ongoing RXS token presale is in its third stage, and the RXS token is priced at $0.05. Rexas Finance aims to transform and enhance how real-world assets can be traded and held by increasing their liquidity, transparency, and accessibility through the blockchain system.

Why Rexas Finance Could Outperform Hamster Kombat
The Rexas Finance project is driven by its real-world asset tokenizing strategy, which presents a real use case that most new cryptos lack.

The platform is emerging at a pivotal time in the RWA space. The RWA crypto market is valued at over $8 billion, but research from McKinsey suggests that the RWA industry could reach a value of $2 trillion by 2030.
Rexas addresses this growing market by allowing fractional ownership and tradability of physical assets such as real estate, art, and intellectual property. The project has already been marketed to institutional investors, a further indication of the potential growth of the project.

The people behind Rexas Finance could have easily gone for a venture capital route but they opted for a public presale so that ordinary investors could also enter the project at an early stage.

With its limited supply and genuine utility, RXS could pose a better long-term investment than inherently volatile meme coins like Hamster Kombat.

Investment Comparison Rexas Finance vs. Hamster Kombat.
Short-Term Perspective Against Long-Term Perspective
For meme coin investors with a high-risk tolerance or those seeking P2E gaming investments, Hamster Kombat could be an ideal choice for a short-term investment. If the game becomes a masterpiece, the resulting surge could offer good returns to early investors.

However, these types of price explosions are often short-term unless the project adds more value or new features to the ecosystem.
On the other hand, Rexas Finance is aiming for long-term growth as the tokenization of assets in the real world is likely to disrupt many industries such as real estate, commodities, and even art.

The increasing momentum of RWA tokenization is viewed as one of the next hot trends for blockchain applications, and Rexas Finance is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. Also, the price for the token will increase throughout the presale, providing benefits for early investors.

Community vs. Institutional Support
Hamster Kombat like most if not all of the meme coins is largely about community and social media endorsement. This can lead to revenue increases but renders the token susceptible to changes in market sentiment or the arrival of a new viral token.

On the contrary, Rexas Finance has managed to capture retail and institutional investors, which can help Rexas weather market lows or changes in trends.

Should You Buy Hamster Kombat or Rexas Finance?Both Hmaster Kombat and Rexas Finance are intriguing investment opportunities, however, any investment decisions should be made based on your own research and analysis of your own risk tolerance.

For short-term market fluctuations, Hamster Kombat, with its tap-to-earn game style and current virality, may be a good option.

For those looking for more long-term speculation, an RWA-focused cryptocurrency could prove less volatile should the Rexas Finance platform hold a successful presale and each a wider audience.

With its great emphasis on real-world asset tokenization, carefully designed tokenomics, and institutional interest, Rexas Finance could be a strong competitor in the RWA space. As usual, when making any investment, prospective investors should carry out due diligence to ensure the potential risks are weighed against the possible gains.

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States recorded a significant daily net inflow of $365.57 million on Thursday, marking the largest influx since late July.

This latest surge extends the positive streak to six consecutive days, according to data from Sosolvalue.

Leading Thursday’s inflows was the ARKB ETF, managed by Ark Invest and 21Shares, which saw a substantial addition of $113.82 million.

BlackRock’s IBIT Also Sees Inflows
BlackRock’s IBIT, the largest spot Bitcoin ETF in terms of net assets, followed closely with $93.38 million in net inflows.

Fidelity’s FBTC also experienced a strong performance, attracting $74 million.

Bitwise’s BITB reported a net inflow of $50.38 million, while VanEck’s HODL added $22.10 million.


Smaller net inflows were observed across other funds from Valkyrie, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust.

However, it wasn’t a perfect day for all players. Grayscale’s GBTC was the only ETF to report a net outflow, losing $7.73 million in assets.

Despite this setback, the overall performance of spot bitcoin ETFs was robust, with total trade volume among the 12 funds reaching $2.43 billion—the highest since August 23.

With Thursday’s inflows, the total cumulative net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs since their inception have now risen to $18.31 billion.

The impressive inflows come amid a broader bullish sentiment across global risk markets.

“It’s all green lights for global risk markets as U.S. equities hit new all-time highs for the third time this week,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SOFA.org.

“The rally has been fueled by rapid stimulus measures to revive the struggling Chinese economy, which has led renowned macro observers to turn explicitly bullish on all risk assets in the interim. The synchronized global easing move is reminiscent of the easy-money days of the QE era.”


Ethereum ETFs See Outflows
While Bitcoin ETFs flourished, the performance of spot Ethereum ETFs painted a different picture.

The sector saw a net outflow of around $675,450 on Thursday, despite net inflows across six funds.

Grayscale’s ETHE posted the largest outflow, losing $36 million, according to Sosolvalue data.

On the positive side, Fidelity’s FETH recorded net inflows of $15.92 million, and BlackRock’s ETHA added $14.85 million.

Invesco’s QETH saw a modest net inflow of $2 million, while funds from Bitwise, VanEck, and 21Shares reported inflows of under $1 million each.

The nine Ether ETFs registered a total trade volume of $257.40 million on Thursday, more than doubling Wednesday’s $124.18 million.

However, since their launch in July, they have collectively posted net outflows of $581.61 million.

In the broader cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin’s price climbed 2.9% over the past 24 hours to $65,330.96, its highest level since late July.

Ether also saw gains, rising 1.8% to $2,648.

Fan believes this crypto rally has more “staying power” than previous ones.

“Investor sentiment has shifted to a ‘buy the dip’ mentality, and with no significant downside catalysts in sight, the risk-reward balance seems to favor a continued rally,” he said.
Meme coins are regularly making headlines for furnishing some of their lucky investors with quick fortunes.

Today, the sector is positively surging. According to CoinGecko data, the collective market capitalization of meme coins stands at a towering $51.1 million, up 7.7% in the last 24 hours.

Some of the fastest climbers in recent months have been the outliers, meme coins that are too new to be considered “blue chip” like Dogecoin ($DOGE) or its biggest amphibian rival, Pepe ($PEPE), but that could very well be by this time next year.

Here we’ll examine five of the biggest right now to see their likelihood of hitting $1 billion.

The $1 Billion Meme Bet: $MOODENG?
First up, say hello to Moo Deng, Thailand’s viral baby pygmy hippo sensation. Her name means “bouncy pork” and she’s always hyperactive and soggy:


Earlier this week, one anonymous investor turned an initial purchase of $401 worth of $MOODENG into nearly half a million dollars.


Moo Deng’s ascent has been rapid since it launched two weeks ago, and the token itself has perfect cultural clout as a hippo in a sector saturated with cat and dog coins. However, Moo Deng currently has a market cap of $6.9 million, which means that unless its community can shill it with the same intensity over the next three months, it’s unlikely to hit the milestone.

Or is it $SUNDOG?
Sundog ($SUNDOG) is the biggest meme coin on Justin Sun’s TRON blockchain. Since early August, Sun has been promoting SunPump, a meme coin minting protocol that is supposed to be TRON’s answer to Solana’s Pump.fun.

However, Sundog may be exiting the limelight soon. Its market capitalization remains unchanged from a fortnight ago at a third of a billion but the token has fallen from thirteenth to nineteenth biggest meme coin. With plenty of fresh competition, Sundog offers very little by way of a USP except that it is essentially Dogecoin on TRON.


How About $MOG and $TURBO?
The year-old Mog and Turbo coins are interesting considerations for the next billion dollar meme coin. The $576 million market cap Mog’s current claim to fame is that it’s the second biggest cat meme in the sector, besides the billion dollar Popcat ($POPCAT).

Meanwhile, Turbo has some cultural clout. He’s another character from Max Furie’s Boys Club, the webcomic which birthed $PEPE and $BRETT, which have market caps of $4 billion and $1 billion respectively. They’re also the best performing assets in this article when you consider the fact that they’ve both blown up more than 9,000% over the last year.

Onto $NEIRO
Neiro’s developers want $NEIRO to be a billion dollar meme coin. They want it so bad they even airdropped Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin 4% of the supply, which was worth about $130,000 on August 3 in a marketing stunt. He promptly dumped the lot.


As an Ethereum-based dog-themed meme coin with a forward marketing team, Neiro really does little to stand out.

It may be more energy efficient that Dogecoin, but the Big Five ($DOGE, $SHIB, $WIF, $BONK and $FLOKI) are not likely to concede an inch of ground to the newcomer, especially now that all of them are adding utility to the concept.

Could It Be Crypto All-Stars?
It’s too early to say decisively whether any of these coins go the mile and hit a $1 billion market cap. Meme coins can often be flash-in-the-pan phenomena but some brand new projects in the space are aiming to give the sector a shot at longevity.

Those who want to support the meme coin sector by investing in projects with stronger fundamentals can diversify their portfolios with some of the new presales redefining meme coins.

One such project—a unified staking protocol for meme coin fans—is Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) a revolutionary platform that brings together the most celebrated meme coins in one place.

Holders of Pepe Coin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Floki Inu, Based Brett, MogCoin, Milady, TurboToken, Toshi The Cat, Coq Inu, and BonkCoin can stake them in the MemeVault and earn passive income in the form of $STARS with a rewards rate currently set at 901%.

crypto all stars
The team has allocated 20% of the tokens for its presale; the other 25% is for presale staking, 20% for marketing, 10% CEX/DEX listing, and the remaining 25% for the MemeVault ecosystem.

The project has gained so much popularity that its presale has already raised over $1.65 million.Leading fintech firms Robinhood Markets and Revolut are reportedly seeking to enter the $173 billion stablecoin market, Bloomberg reported. Both companies are considering issuing their own stablecoins but haven’t confirmed the move.

Sources close to the matter told Bloomberg that Robinhood and Revolut could “still opt not to proceed” from launching stablecoins.

The move comes as the European Union edges closer to fully enacting its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations this year.

The move aims to loosen Tether’s grip on the rapidly moving stablecoin sector. Bloomberg report noted that the business model is encouraging more players to enter the market.

Tether (USDT) circulation has grown to almost $120 billion, dominating more than two-thirds of the stablecoin market, the report added. Per DefiLlama, Tether accounts for 69.14% of stablecoin dominance.

In July, Tether reported a record-breaking $5.2 million profit in first half of 2024. Further, the stablecoin’s US Treasury portfolio is worth approximately $97.6 billion.


Further, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, recently raised concerns that the MiCA regulation poses a systemic risk to stablecoins and the broader banking system. He told the publication that the company is working on a “technology-based solution” to serve the EU market.

Robinhood, Revolut Haven’t Confirmed Stablecoin Move
Although sources note that both fintech giants Robinhood and Revolut might explore stablecoins, a Robinhood spokesperson said it has “no imminent plans to launch this offering.”

On the other hand, a Revolut executive said that the firm is planning to “further grow” its crypto product suite. The fintech firm is reportedly evaluating options to release a stablecoin but has yet to make any announcements.

As reported in July, Robinhood is exploring the possibility of cryptocurrency futures trading in the US and Europe. The platform said that it would introduce futures trading “in the coming months.”

However, a spokesperson from Robinhood said that the company has no immediate plans for such offerings.
Base, the Layer 2 Ethereum network developed by Coinbase, has crossed the $2 billion milestone in total value locked (TVL), making it the second-largest optimistic rollup by deposits, just behind Arbitrum.

Data from DeFiLlama shows that Base’s TVL reached $2.08 billion, a significant increase from approximately $430 million at the beginning of the year, representing a 370% growth year-to-date.

Launched in August 2023, Base operates as an optimistic rollup, which processes transactions off the Ethereum mainnet and only periodically posts data on-chain.

This approach reduces the load on Ethereum, enhancing its transaction throughput and efficiency.

Base’s Growth Driven by Aerodrome
The growth in Base’s TVL has been primarily driven by the decentralized exchange Aerodrome, which accounts for over $1 billion of the total deposits.

Uniswap also plays a key role, contributing around $220 million.


Despite Arbitrum leading in TVL among optimistic rollups, Base has outperformed in terms of user activity.

Metrics such as active addresses and daily transactions have positioned it at the forefront of the optimistic rollup sector, according to data from The Block.

As reported, DeFi appears to be experiencing a resurgence, as key indicators such as active loans and TVL show significant growth from their 2023 lows.

For one, active loans have climbed to approximately $13.3 billion, levels not seen since early 2022.

DeFi lending, which allows investors to lend their crypto holdings to borrowers in exchange for interest, is a crucial metric for assessing DeFi participation and overall market health.

During the 2021 crypto bull run, DeFi active loans peaked at $22.2 billion, coinciding with Bitcoin and Ethereum nearing $69,000 and $4,800, respectively.

However, this figure plummeted to around $10 billion by March 2022 and further to $3.1 billion in January 2023.

Since hitting its low last year, the sector has rebounded significantly, with active loans rising back to $13.3 billion.

TVL in DeFi also suffered a dramatic decline last year, falling 80% from its November 2021 peak of $180 billion to approximately $37 billion by October 2023.

However, the sector has since seen a remarkable recovery of around 160%, with TVL now standing at roughly $96.5 billion, according to DefiLlama.

Coinbase Asks Court to Pressure SEC Over Crypto Regulations
Just recently, Coinbase urged a federal appeals court in Philadelphia on Monday to pressure the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create new crypto rules.

Coinbase appealed to the court, that the SEC had made it impossible for it to operate and comply with regulations.

Eugene Scalia, a lawyer for Coinbase, said the SEC had been “arbitrary and capricious.”

The regulator has not been giving Coinbase clarity on how to register and comply with U.S. laws, Scalia added.

Coinbase sued the SEC last year, demanding rules that clarify standards for determining when cryptos are securities.

However, the SEC denied its claims in December, disagreeing that the current crypto regulations are “unworkable.”

Earlier this month, the exchange secured a partial victory against the SEC, potentially gaining access to critical documents regarding the agency’s classification of tokens as securities.
Swan Bitcoin took legal action this week against several former employees and a competitor, Proton Management. The company accused them of a deliberate attempt to undermine and seize its Bitcoin mining operations.

This ongoing legal dispute in the US District Court for the Central District of California underscores an alleged betrayal by individuals previously entrusted with the confidential aspects of Swan’s software and business connections.

The allegations paint a picture of corporate espionage where former Swan employees allegedly sabotaged the company from within. They allegedly stole critical software code and customer data. After resigning, they used this information to start a new company, Proton Management. Their goal was to compete directly with their former employer.

On X, Swan CEO Cory Klippsten said that the company’s mining operations have always been “separate and segregated.” He added that the latest news does not impact Swan’s primary business.


Swan Bitcoin Claims Ex-CIO and Business Head Orchestrated Mining Takeover Plan
In the lawsuit, Michael Holmes, once Swan’s Business Development Head, was identified as the mastermind behind Proton. Meanwhile, Raphael Zagury, who previously held the roles of CIO and mining chief at Swan, has taken the helm as Proton’s CEO.


According to the complaint, Proton employees were also accused of poaching staff from Swan’s mining team and redirecting Swan’s financial backer, Tether, to support their own operations. Part of the plan, Swan alleged, involved Tether issuing a default notice to Swan, which would serve as a legal pretext for the hostile takeover.

Swan said it was caught off guard by a wave of resignations on Aug. 8 and 9. Another surprise allegedly followed on Aug. 12 when Tether informed the company that Proton would be taking over its role in the mining agreement.

Tether, although not officially a defendant in the lawsuit, acknowledged the accusations, but rejected any suggestions of misconduct. “As this is an ongoing legal matter, we will refrain from providing further comment at this time,” the company said.

Swan Demands Permanent Injunction in Lawsuit Over Alleged Misconduct by Ex-Employees and Tether
Further, Swan asserts that this misconduct not only breaches contractual confidentiality but also inflicts immediate and irreversible damage to its operations, potentially leading to the loss of business opportunities and a tarnished reputation. The legal complaint suggest a calculated strategy where the former employees, alongside Tether, sought to dismantle Swan’s mining business from the inside out.

Swan has requested request for a permanent injunction against Proton and for the return of misappropriated materials. The outcome of this lawsuit could set a precedent for how intellectual property disputes are handled in the crypto industry.

Swan Bitcoin launched its managed mining service for institutional investors with Tether in May 2024, aiming for 100 exahashes by 2026. However, by July, CEO Cory Klippsten announced the managed mining operation was likely to shut down due to struggles in generating enough revenue quickly. At the same time, the company proceeded with workforce cutbacks and decided against going public.
BNY Mellon’s recent SEC approval for its crypto custody proposal has reignited institutional interest in Bitcoin. As Bitcoin’s price hovers around $65,320, this development could further stabilize its value by boosting investor confidence.

By separating crypto wallets from bank assets, BNY Mellon provides added security for digital assets, increasing the potential for broader adoption. This shift could pave the way for Bitcoin to see continued price momentum as institutions play a larger role in the crypto landscape.

SEC Approves BNY Mellon’s Crypto Custody Proposal
BNY Mellon recently received SEC approval for a proposal on how to custody Bitcoin and Ether, ensuring asset protection in case of bank failure. The SEC’s “non-objection” means BNY Mellon can record the assets’ value on its balance sheet.

This structure keeps crypto wallets and bank accounts separate from other bank assets, safeguarding client funds in bankruptcy.


SEC Chair Gary Gensler noted that any bank with a similar setup would receive the same approval. This move is seen as a way to build institutional trust in digital assets, potentially increasing long-term investments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Michael Saylor Backs BlackRock’s Bullish Bitcoin Outlook
Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, echoed BlackRock’s positive stance on Bitcoin. Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, called Bitcoin a “scarce, global, decentralized asset” with both risk-on and risk-off potential, drawing attention amid concerns over fiat currency devaluation and political instability.


Additionally, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF saw inflows nearing $100 million, outpacing competitors like Bitwise and Fidelity.

Daily Technical Outlook: Bitcoin (BTC/USD) – September 27, 2024
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) trades at $65,320, up 0.26% as it tests key resistance levels, indicating strong bullish momentum.

The cryptocurrency trades above the pivot point of $64,808, signalling a potential breakout after forming a double-top pattern around this level.

If upward momentum continues, immediate resistance is at $65,862, followed by higher targets at $66,539 and $67,152.

On the downside, immediate support rests at $64,170, with further support at $63,493 and $62,688. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently at $63,935, is a crucial support level, reinforcing bullish sentiment as long as prices hold above it.
chnical indicators are painting a favourable picture for BTC. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 65, indicating that while Bitcoin is approaching overbought territory, there’s still room for upward movement.

A sustained close above the $64,800 pivot point could push the cryptocurrency toward its next resistance at $65,862 and potentially higher, aligning with bullish market sentiment.

If Bitcoin breaks below $64,800, we could see a sharp reversal, potentially targeting the $64,170 support level or even deeper corrections toward $63,493.

Traders should monitor price action around the pivot point to gauge the next move.

Russians
The US Justice Department on Thursday announced a crackdown on Russian money laundering operations with an estimated $800m impact.

The agency said it charged two Russian nationals and seized domains linked to crypto exchanges used for laundering. It demonstrates an effort to dismantle the financial networks behind cybercrime and geopolitical influence.


Russian Cybercriminals ‘Taleon’ and ‘JokerStash’ Face DOJ Charges for Alleged Laundering Scheme
Sergey Ivanov, known as “Taleon,” faces charges for money laundering and bank fraud. His operations, including services like UAPS, PinPays, and PM2BTC, allegedly processed over $1.15 billion in transactions. A significant portion of these transactions came from criminal activities, according to the DOJ. The portion of the transactions related to criminal activities would roughly equate to about $368m.

Similarly, Timur Shakhmametov, alias “JokerStash,” is accused of running the carding site Joker’s Stash, which sold millions of stolen payment card details, potentially amassing profits over $1b.

US Secret Service Shuts Down Cryptex Crypto Platform
The US Secret Service also executed the seizure of domains associated with Cryptex, another crypto laundering platform. Investigations revealed over $1.4b in transactions through Cryptex, with significant funds linked to criminal proceeds. This included $441m tied to crimes like fraud and ransomware payments.


These actions were not unilateral but involved international law enforcement. The Netherlands Police, among other European agencies, supported by seizing servers related to PM2BTC and Cryptex.

DOJ’s Coordinated Effort Targets Cyber Financial Crimes
The Justice Department’s actions represent a major offensive against cyber-enabled financial crimes, with a clear message to combat illicit financial flows. This strategy, involving multiple government agencies and international partners, aims to disrupt criminal networks and safeguard global financial integrity.

Earlier this year, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on 13 entities along with two individuals, all accused of creating crypto services potentially aiding Russian nationals in bypassing international sanctions.

The OFAC’s actions were intended to restrict Russia’s ability to leverage the international financial network in the context of its hostilities with Ukraine.

As major cryptos pushed higher on Thursday, with Bitcoin (BTC) surpassing $65,000 to hit new multi-month highs, top crypto gainers today in the DEX markets also saw big moves.

Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies continue to rally amid anticipation that a coordinated global easing of monetary policy will improve liquidity conditions, benefitting riskier assets.


The likes of Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) rose 2.5-5% in the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.

But, in a sign that risk appetite in crypto is jumping, meme coins outperformed.

The likes of Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE) and Dogwifhat (WIF) all spiked up at least 8%, with SHIB rallying 22%.


But the top crypto gainers today were all smaller, newer meme coins trading in the DEX markets.

Here are some of the top crypto gainers today according to DEX analytics tool DEXScreener.

Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXScreener – Which Are They?
A newish dog themed Ethereum meme coin called Doggo (DOGGO) is making a comeback on Thursday.

Per DEXScreener, it gained 109% in the past 24 hours, its market cap recovering to $15 million.

Doggo is now a fully community owned token – when a meme coin has a vibrant, active community, it tends to have much more longevity.


DOGGO could rally substantially from here if it continues to grow its online community.

Another top crypto gainer today with an ever stronger community is new Solana meme coin Moo Deng (MOODENG).

MOODENG surged to a market cap of over $160 million on Thursday, gaining 57% in the past 24 hours per DEXScreener.

Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXScreener
MOODENG was created in honor of a cute baby hippo in Thailand and has been going viral.

In a meme coin market dominated by dog, cat and Pepe the frog memes, a cute hippo has a lot of potential.

That’s especially the case considering the strong and fast growing community of Moo Deng fans.
Moo Deng might very become a $1 billion meme coin one day, as fever continues to rise.

The final name on the top crypto gainers today worth noting is a Base meme coin called Tyler (TYLER).

The Matt Furie-themed cartoon meme coin last had a market cap of $1.5 million, up 500% in 24 hours per DEXScreener.

Over $500,000 in tokens have changed hands in the past 24 hours, with the token having amassed $120,000 in locked liquidity.

The token has no issues with its smart contract, according to Go+ Security, Quick Intel and Token Sniffer audits.

It also seems popular amongst DEXScreener users, with 202 rocket ship emoji votes to just 26 red flag emoji votes.

However, that doesn’t mean the coin isn’t either a scam or pump-and-dump.

Indeed, on-chain DEX markets are replete with scams. Genuine projects (like Moo Deng appears to be) are few and far between.

Better Alternative – Meme Coin Presales?
A better way to invest in small cap meme coins rather than the top crypto gainers today named above might instead be to get involved in meme coin presales.

Presales normally last a few weeks, giving investors plenty of time to research a project before getting involved.

Here are some of the best meme coin presales right now, according to analysts at Cryptonews.com.
If you missed the chance to invest in PEPE coin, let us look at what could be the next Pepe. Popo (FROP) is gearing up for its debut on major cryptocurrency exchanges.

For those looking for the next x100 opportunity, Popo’s upcoming exchange listings could be your chance to get in early on a project that combines strong tokenomics, multichain capabilities, and a dedicated community.

Here’s everything you need to know about Popo before it officially launches.

About Popo: presale success and multichain flexibility
Popo (FROP) is a project with a narrative and a clear mission. Popo is seeking revenge against his cousin Pepe for the destruction of their homeland.

While the story gives Popo a unique edge, the project is also built with a solid foundation in terms of functionality.

One of its standout features is its multichain capability. Unlike many meme coins limited to one blockchain, $FROP operates across multiple chains.
These include Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, BNB, Base, Optimism, Polygon and Solana. This multichain flexibility allows users to trade and interact with $FROP tokens on a variety of networks.

The presale for $FROP has already attracted major attention, raising $1.6 million so far. Early investors have been able to purchase tokens ahead of the official exchange listings.

With such a strong presale showing, Popo is proving that there is real demand for its token. If you haven’t gotten involved yet, now might be your chance to join before the presale ends.

The coin price is $0.000607. Click on “Connect Wallet” on their website and connect with the wallets mentioned to start. FROP token goes live on September 30. So presale is only available for a short period of time.

Strong tokenomics
The total supply of $FROP is capped at 111,111,111,111 tokens. This ensures scarcity and helping to drive demand as the project grows.

Presale (25%): A quarter of the total supply is reserved for presale.
Staking (25%): Another 25% is dedicated to staking rewards.
Marketing (25%): To ensure Popo gains visibility in the competitive meme coin market, 25% of the token supply is allocated to marketing efforts.
Rewards (15%): 15% of the supply for community rewards and airdrops.
Liquidity (10%): 10% is reserved for liquidity on centralized and decentralized exchanges.
This balanced distribution ensures that Popo has the resources to grow, reward its community, and maintain liquidity.

Roadmap: What’s Next for Popo?
From the early stages of launching its website to the upcoming exchange listings, each step is designed to build momentum and ensure the project’s growth. Here’s a look at the key phases of Popo’s roadmap:

The initial phase involved launching the website, creating the token contract, and establishing a social media presence. This phase laid the groundwork for building Popo’s community.

The next phase focused on contract audits and community building. The team disclosed its long-term plans, ensuring transparency and building trust with early supporters.

In the next phase, the presale was launched, and an extensive marketing campaign began to generate buzz. The staking platform was also released, allowing early investors to start earning rewards on their $FROP tokens.

The upcoming phase will see $FROP listed on centralized exchanges (CEX) and the launch of the $FROP Farm Game. This will add utility to the token, allowing users to earn rewards while participating in the game. The Popo Gaming Lounge will also be introduced, providing a hub for community engagement.
Becoming a part of Popo at the right time
If you missed out on Pepe or other meme coins that exploded in value, now is your chance to get involved with Popo before it takes off.

Popo has mentioned future exchange listings including OKX, Gate.io, KuCoin, HTX, MEXC, and Bybit. Once you buy the tokens, you can also stake them to earn over 1800% APR.

Over a billion FROP tokens have been staked so far. They have a burn mechanism where FROP supply will be burned to raise demand.

The combination of an engaged community, a clear roadmap, and upcoming exchange listings makes Popo a project to watch in the coming months.

Russian Experts: Altseason May Return – But It Won’t Be The Same as Before
Russian experts believe that altseason may return this year, with new impetus coming into the altcoin market. But they have warned that the market “won’t be like it was before.”

VG GROUP Managing Partner Vagiz Nurullov remarked that summer is “not the most active and successful period for trading, especially cryptocurrencies,” Russia’s RBC reported.

Altseason to Begin in November?
Nurullov said that crypto suffers from “not having as much liquidity as global stock markets,” as well as increased volatility.

However, with the summer months now gone, the expert opined that more “active” periods may be ahead.

“We are, generally speaking, entering a more active stage of the market. We can see that the market is wtinessing an increase in open interest. And, in general, traders are entering into transactions more actively. Their appetite for risk has increased.”

The media outlet pointed out that “although September is traditionally a weak month” for crypto, “the overall market value of cryptocurrencies continued to rise in early autumn.”


Since the beginning of the month, RBC remarked, the market “has grown by 7%,” despite bumpy Bitcoin (BTC) prices.

Russian analysts said they believe that much depends on BTC prices. They opined that Bitcoin “needs to consolidate above the $65,200 mark “to confirm the change of downward trends to an upward direction.”

Nurullov said experts “can see an increase in open interest,” although he conceded that this was “not very strong yet,” as the market is still “awakening.”

He added that the market is now at a stage where several positive forces are pulling in the same upward direction.

He identified these as:

forthcoming FTX investor repayments
the Fed’s willingness to cut interest rates
the US elections
crypto market seasonality
Global Factors Set to Come into Play
Oleg Kalmanovich, an analyst at Neomarkets, concurred. He claimed that the Fed’s first rate cut since 2020 was “the key event of the current financial year.”

Kalmanovich explained that this would mark the start of “a cycle of reductions in bank interest rates.”

And this, he added, was “traditionally a strong trigger for the growth of risky assets, such as cryptocurrency.”


The analyst explained that “large capital” was “beginning to lose interest in lower-rate dollar deposits.”

And this, he said, would soon see money “redirected” to assets like alts. Kalmanovich added that the prospect of further rate cuts would also help drive up crypto activity.

The expert said that observers would do well to pay attention to the latest batch of figures on the US labor market, which will go public on October 4.

And he also agreed that the US presidential election, on November 5, would provide further opportunity for growth.

Kalmanovich noted that “the banking sector typically tries to provide the economy and markets with maximum liquidity before this event.”

That could help “the growth of a wide range of cryptoassets,” the expert opined.

Experts Urge Caution
However, there were also words of caution. Any forthcoming “altcoin season” will “not be like those we are used to seeing,” Nurullov forecasted.

He said that in previous “alt seasons,” traders were not forced to choose from such a large range of new crypto projects, as is currently the case.

The experts suggested that a “first wave of growth” would likely hit the markets “by early November.”

A second may emerge “by March,” they said, although they agreed that much would depend on the outcome of the US elections.


Kalmanovich said there was room for growth in projects that are “a little behind the growth schedule,” but are “not yet significantly overbought.”

He earmarked assets such as NEAR (NEAR), XRP, and Polkadot (DOT), explaining that these alts’ “prices have been lagging behind the rest since the beginning of the year.”

Such tokens “can still make up for lost time,” using lower rates in Western economies as “fuel,” Kalmanovich added.

In recent days, analysts like Moustache have made similar predictions, claiming that the coming altseason could be the “biggest altcoin bull run since 2017.

BONK’s Bullish Week: Trading Volume Explodes
BONK’s Bullish Week: Trading Volume Explodes / Source: Cryptonews
Its been a very bullish week for Bonk (BONK), with the crypto having pumping up an impressive 16.4% according to TradingView.

Bonk, one of the leading meme coins on Solana and the fifth ranked meme coin by market cap, is now up 30% versus its earlier monthly lows.

Its latest push higher comes amid surging trading volumes. Per Yahoo Finance, $223 million in BONK changed hands across major exchanges on the 26th of September.

That’s the most in trading volume on any one single day since the 6th of August, and the day isn’t even over yet.

Bonk’s rally from the September lows comes in tandem with a rise seen across the crypto space.

The Fed initiated an interest rate cutting cycle last week and that, combined with declining fears of a near-term US recession, has spurred a pick-up in risk appetite.
A new rate cutting cycle should significantly improve liquidity conditions in global markets, a positive for risk assets.

And some are now predicting the return of a new meme season.

Bonk, thanks to its status as a leading Solana meme coin, could be a major beneficiary.

Here’s where it could be headed next.

BONK – Where Is It Going Next?
A new meme season may be coming, but the BONK chat isn’t yet screaming bullish.

On the contrary, BONK remains stuck well below an uptrend it broke below over the summer.

The bears might be tempted to fade any short-term recovery to the $0.0000028 area.
That said, traders will remember the meme season of late 2023, which lasted from October to December.

BONK more than 10xed during this time, blowing bears out of the water.

Solana meme coin BONK might not 10x again this time, but it could easily blow through its record highs in the $0.0000040 area.

BONK Alternative to Consider – Crypto All-stars (STARS)
Bonk has a lot of upside potential, but its already bloated market cap of around $1.4 billion, per CoinMarketCap, suggests there is limited room for further exponential gains.

For investors looking to bag 10, 20 or even 50x gains, meme coin presales might be a better option.

Presales allow investors to participate in up-and-coming projects before they gain broader traction and interest.

If an investor can get into the right meme coin presale, they could bag huge gains.

One project that analysts at Cryptonews.com think has big potential is an exciting new meme coin staking protocol called Crypto All-stars (STARS).

The presale has been garnering a lot of excitement in meme coin trading circles given it offers meme coin investors an opportunity to earn a yield on their holdings.

All meme coin investors must do it own STARS and then lock their tokens in the so-called MemeVault for a big STARS yield.

The more STARS tokens users own, the higher the yield they receive, incentivizing early participation.

Cryptonews.com thinks Crypto All-stars is one of the meme coin presales with the highest potential in the market right now.

See the below video to see why Cryptonews.com’s in-house analyst Chester explain why it has 100x potential.
Police in Moscow, Russia, say they have shut down a “cross-border” crypto exchange that they think helped clients send money abroad.

Officials said the exchange operators pretended they were operating a travel agency. But in fact, police claimed, the agency was a front for a cross-border crypto exchange.

And police said the suspected exchange processed $2.2 million worth of crypto transactions for Russian clients.

‘Cross-Border Crypto Exchange’ Charged 1% Commission Fees – Ministry
In a Telegram post from the Russian Interior Ministry, a spokesperson explained that they had conducted a raid on the suspected exchange’s officers.

Police think the operators carried out “illegal banking activities,” and took 1% commission fees from cash-paying customers who wanted to transfer money to overseas-based crypto wallets.

The ministry posted a video showing agents raiding the office. Ministry officials are shown examining bundles of United States dollars, receipts, and computer equipment.

The video also shows officers questioning a male staff member, and asking what the business had been doing. The staff member replies:

“We didn’t do anything. We conducted crypto exchange transactions. And nothing else.”

The ministry said it also searched other offices and private apartments, where it seized “cash in various currencies,” as well as “communication devices, documents, and other items.”


Officers said they had charged a suspected “ringleader” ahead of a prosecution investigation.

Police said their own investigation was still ongoing as they attempted to identify more “accomplices.”

Officers added that the main service the “exchange” provided consisted of allowing Russians to “withdraw funds” from outside the country.

They claimed that the group essentially used crypto as a remittance tool.

Multiple Exchanges Active in Moscow?
In March 2023, multiple reports surfaced claiming Russians were using “several” Moscow crypto exchanges to send the stablecoin Tether (USDT) to people based in the UK.

The reports claimed these exchanges are “offering services” that let Russians “withdraw cash funds” in the UK.

In May this year, the Russian Central Bank said it had detected a sharp rise in citizens’ transactions on crypto exchanges and peer-to-peer trading platforms.

Crypto exchanges currently have no legal status in Russia. However, Russian law contains multiple stipulations about cross-border fiat currency transfer.

Many have accused unofficial exchanges of flaunting these laws under the guise of providing crypto investment services.
FLOCKERZ, a newly launched decentralized project, is redefining the meme coin sector with its Vote-to-Earn mechanism. The project has gained attention during its presale phase, raising over $260,000.

With a focus on community governance and decentralization, FLOCKERZ offers investors an early opportunity to buy $FLOCK tokens before the price appreciates on global exchange platforms.

FLOCKERZ operates under a unique structure where community members, known as “The Flock,” play a direct role in shaping the future of the project.

Through the Vote-to-Earn platform, participants are rewarded for their involvement in major decisions, marking a shift in the governance of meme coins.

Join FLOCKERZ and Earn Today!

What Sets FLOCKERZ Apart from Other Meme Coins?
Unlike traditional meme coin projects, which are often controlled by a select group of insiders, FLOCKERZ gives its community complete control over key decisions.


Every $FLOCK owner is guaranteed to have a say in the governance of the project by the Vote-to- Earn system. To encourage active participation, this creative method gives community members $FLOCK tokens for voting and decision-making involvement.

The core project center, Flocktopia, deviates greatly from the standard in crypto governance. Decisions are taken here by the community as a whole instead of by a central power.

This distributed strategy lets both new and experienced crypto aficionados help the project to be successful. By means of Flocktopia, $FLOCK holders guide the project and receive benefits for their involvement, therefore fostering a self-sustaining ecology.

Roadmap: The Bird King’s Flight Plan
The FLOCKERZ roadmap is structured in several phases, each focusing on different aspects of growth and expansion. The project has already taken steps forward, including a comprehensive security audit and the launch of its presale. These initiatives aim to secure the $FLOCK contract and build trust within the community.

The next phase involves further expansion through global marketing efforts. FLOCKERZ plans to spread its reach across the globe, attracting new investors and expanding the community.

Following the presale, FLOCKERZ will proceed to have its $FLOCK tokens listed on a range of centralized and decentralized exchanges, therefore providing a wider availability of the token. As the project progresses, the implementation of the Vote-to-Earn mechanism will be crucial in motivating involvement and promoting sustained commitment.

Tokenomics: A Well-Structured Plan for Growth
Developed in order to assist its expansion and honor early adopters, FLOCKERZ has created a thorough tokenomics framework For early bird buyers engaged in the presale, the initiative has set aside 20% of the entire supply.

Early project participants get rewards from this allocation, which also gives them the opportunity to profit from future price increase. 25% of all the tokens are also set aside for staking incentives.

By locking their tokens, this staking mechanism lets devoted $FLOCK holders earn rewards, hence motivating long-term project engagement.

Another 25% is stored in the Flock DAO Vault, a treasury managed by the community. This vault will be used to allocate funds for the continued development of the project, with rewards distributed to those who actively participate in governance.

FLOCKERZ has also allocated 10% of its supply to fuel liquidity for trading on centralized and decentralized exchanges. This ensures smooth trading and prevents price volatility during the token’s listing phase.

Finally, 20% of the supply is dedicated to marketing efforts, allowing FLOCKERZ to spread awareness and attract more participants to the project.


The Presale’s Early Success and Future Outlook
The FLOCKERZ project has already achieved significant milestones during its presale phase, raising over $260,000 in funds. This early success reflects growing interest in the project’s unique decentralized model and Vote-to-Earn mechanism.

While the presale is still under progress, FLOCKERZ provides investors with a chance to purchase tokens early on before the price increases following token listing on international markets.

The project should draw more investors and crypto aficionados as it picks momentum. Combining FLOCKERZ’s distributed character with its creative governance structure, helps to explain why it might be a game-changer in the meme coin market.

Participating in the presale allows investors to receive $FLOCK tokens at a reduced cost and directly help to shape the direction of the project.

Join FLOCKERZ and Earn Today!

FLOCKERZ’s Unique Governance Model: Power to the People
FLOCKERZ’s unique governance model is fully decentralized and driven by community participation. Unlike traditional projects where decisions are made by a small group of insiders, FLOCKERZ gives its community full control over the project’s direction.

Under the Vote-to-Earn system, holders may vote on important choices including project development, token burns, and growth plans. This distributed government structure guarantees that no one entity accumulates undue authority.

Rather, “The Flock’s combined brainpower propels the success of the endeavor. This method not only distributes power but also encourages involvement by giving voters $FLOCK tokens. Consequently, FLOCKERZ has developed a community-driven ecosystem in which every member contributes to define the course of the project.
Being highly volatile, it is easy to miss meme coins when they are cheap and accessible. Most meme coin investors are stuck in regret.

For them, here is another opportunity.

Popo ($FROP) is a new froggy coin with plans for redemption. The blue poison dart frog gives those who missed Pepe a second shot at meme coin glory.

The Tribal Warrior is Seeking Revenge
Popo recently launched its presale, which is soaring toward the $1.5 million milestone now. It is set to debut on cryptocurrency exchanges on September 30th.

The hype is building fast. The quirky yet charming narrative is catching the attention of meme coin investors.


With this tale, Popo captures the very essence of why people fell for Pepe in the first place. Now the third-largest meme coin, Pepe rode a wild rollercoaster to success.


But Pepe’s growth has slowed, and it seems to have hit a saturation point. New investors, hoping to cash in on its four-digit gains, are likely to be disappointed.

This is where promising new projects like Popo step in.

Farm Game and Gaming Lounge For Utility
Those who buy $FROP in the presale stage get a strategic entry into the investment. The low initial market leaves the project wide open for exponential returns.

Popo is more than just a cool story. With the upcoming launch of a Farm Game and Gaming Lounge, it is set to inject utility into the coin. They are expected to create long-term demand and engagement within the community.

If they take off as planned, they will give investors more reason to stick even after the initial hype subsides.


The meme coin community has a chance to rally behind Popo’s cause by joining the presale. It comes with attractive discounts and staking APYs.

Popo will be available on eight major blockchains like BNB (its main chain), Solana, Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base.

A team of top influencers from both Web2 and Web3 markets are coming together to spread the word about the #popoarmy. That will give $FROP strong market exposure, setting the stage for turbocharged price actions.

Join the Popo community on X (Twitter) and Telegram for the latest presale updates.


Audited and KYC-verified
Just like hype and utility, transparency and security are also important for the long-term success of a meme coin.

Popo has focused on establishing its credibility right from the beginning.

Completed a security audit by SolidProof
Completed KYC verification through Pinksale.
The smart contract is made publicly available for community review.
These measures give confidence to early investors in the project’s technical foundation.


Tokenomics Built for the Community
Popo’s tokenomics is designed for long-term growth.

Beyond staking, Popo plans to introduce airdrops and other incentive programs.

The strategic token allocations build awareness about the meme coin, catalyse its virality, and strengthens the bond between the project and its backers.


As the token’s journey unfolds, investors will be presented with different streams to earn rewards.

$FROP is launching a burn mechanism to create scarcity by gradually reducing its overall supply. Unsold tokens from the presale will be burned, helping drive up the token’s value as demand increases.

Will Popo Overtake Pepe?
Popo surpassing Pepe’s market cap this year is a wildly ambitious goal. It is unlikely to materialize. Pepe has a clear head start with its multi-billion-dollar valuation.

That, however, doesn’t mean Popo can’t deliver attractive returns.


Popo has plenty of room to grow, thanks to its lower initial market cap. Early backers who secure the tokens during the presale at low prices could be rewarded once $FROP hits the exchanges.

With nearly $1.5 million raised already, Popo has been building significant momentum.

The Clock Is Ticking: $FROP Launches September 30th
Popo’s presale is rapidly closing in on a sell-out.

The chance to grab $FROP at a discounted rate is now. The residual FOMO from the presale could skyrocket demand for $FROP once it goes live on exchanges.

If you’re planning to jump into the presale, head over to the official Popo website. Both crypto and fiat payments are supported. But a crypto wallet is a prerequisite to joining the presale.

Timing is everything in investment. If Popo is your next chance to leap into meme coin action, the presale discounts and staking APYs shouldn’t be missed.
South Korean police officers in South Jeolla Province say they have arrested seven suspects in a raid on a “crypto-powered drug dealing” ring.

Per the media outlet KBC, police think the group smuggled methamphetamine into the country from overseas.

The Narcotics Crime Investigation Unit of the province’s Mobile Criminal Investigation Department said they had handed the case over to prosecution officials.

Crypto-powered Drug Dealing Crackdown
The unit announced on September 23 that they had arrested an unnamed 33-year-old suspected drug dealer on charges of violating the Narcotics Control Act.

It also announced it had charged six people aged between 20 and 49 with buying and using methamphetamine.

The suspected dealer is accused of “colluding with a drug distribution organization” to hide methamphetamine in 118 locations in Gwangju’s West and North districts.


Officers think the suspect was active “between March and April of this year,” and took unnamed cryptoassets as payment.

They think he hid a stash of smuggled narcotics under a tree in a remote mountainside location.

Bags thought to have been prepared for use to distribute narctorics.

Officers said that the dealer covered bags of narcotics “with plastic and paper” and used “double-sided tape” to attach “deliveries.”

The suspected dealer’s “dead drop” locations included “the railings of a one-room apartment block.”

Police spokespeople said the dealer also left drugs in “the inside of a communication terminal box,” as well as a “fire hose” and an “outdoor air conditioning unit.”


Police Sting
The investigators appear to have set up a sting operation to catch the suspected dealer. They explained that they “searched social media” for crypto-related slang terms.

They then used a chat app (presumably Telegram) to contact the suspect. They then used crypto to pay for drugs, as part of a bid to discover the suspect’s identity.

This eventually allowed them to find not only the suspect, but also his “drug den.” Officers said they confiscated 103.4g of the drug “hidden in a mountain in Gyeonggi Province.”

Police also said they had confiscated 83.35g of methamphetamine that the suspect had “hidden around” the city of Gwangju.

Officers said the drug haul had a street value of “approximately 620 million won (over $465,000).” They said the haul constituted “6,200 individual doses.”

The police said they were expanding their investigation to “identify the true nature of the drug distribution organization.”

Crypto to Blame for Drugs Epidemic, Officials Claim
Earlier this year, media outlets claimed that Telegram has become a “crypto-powered narcotics department store” for South Korean users.


And earlier this month, South Korean customs officials blamed “the spread of crypto” for an 18% rise in drug smuggling cases.

Customs service spokespeople said they seized 769kg worth of narcotics last year, up from 624kg in 2022.

Some have claimed that this is proof that the nation’s crypto-powered narcotics “epidemic” is continuing to worsen, in spite of police crackdowns.

Nigerian Court Schedules Binance Tax Evasion Verdict for October
Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, has been sentenced to two years in prison for her role in the collapse of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX.

Ellison, 29, was sentenced at the United States Southern District of New York on September 24. She appeared before Judge Lewis Kaplan in the Manhattan federal courthouse.

Judge Says Ellison’s Cooperation With Prosecutors “Remarkable”
Kaplan described Ellison’s cooperation with prosecutors as “remarkable”, adding that he was not comfortable with remorse and cooperation being a “get out of jail free card” in a case so serious, reports Reuters.

Ellison also had a personal relationship with FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, who was recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for embezzling over $8 billion from the company’s customers.

Her sentencing follows a plea deal in which she admitted to charges of wire fraud and money laundering. As part of her cooperation with prosecutors, she testified against Bankman-Fried, providing crucial details about the inner workings of the fraudulent scheme.

In addition to her prison term, Ellison has been ordered to forfeit assets worth more than $11 billion though this amount may increase if further restitution is demanded.

Caroline Ellison Played Critical in Bankman-Fried’s Conviction
Caroline Ellison’s testimony against Bankman-Fried was critical in securing his conviction. He was found guilty of orchestrating a massive fraud by misappropriating customer funds to make risky investments, fund lavish lifestyles, and donate to political campaigns.


Bankman-Fried has attempted to discredit Ellison as a witness by releasing pages of her personal diary to The New York Times ahead of his trial.

Earlier this month, Bankman-Fried’s legal team filed a request for a new trial, claiming he was denied a fair hearing during his criminal conviction. In a brief filed with the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. they argued that federal prosecutors were more focused on securing quick headlines than ensuring a just trial.

BNY Mellon
US bank BNY is making strides towards offering custody services for Bitcoin and Ether, specifically for its exchange-traded product (ETP) clients. This development follows a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) review, which has important implications for how banks handle digital assets, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.

Earlier this year, the SEC’s Office of the Chief Accountant reportedly reviewed BNY Mellon’s approach to crypto custody. The outcome? The SEC didn’t object to BNY Mellon’s decision not to include these crypto assets as liabilities on its balance sheet.

This review was crucial because of the SEC’s SAB 121 rule, which requires banks to account for crypto assets they safeguard as both a liability and an asset on their balance sheets. BNY Mellon’s unique case with ETPs, however, seems to bypass this requirement, at least for now.

BNY told Cryptonews that it received confirmation from the SEC’s Office of the Chief Accountant that they have no objection to the bank’s approach of not treating digital assets, held for SEC-registered crypto-asset ETPs, as liabilities on its balance sheet.

What is SAB 121?
SAB 121 is a rule that the SEC set to enhance transparency in the financial statements of entities that safeguard crypto assets for others. It mandates these entities to recognize the crypto they hold as liabilities, aiming to clarify the risks involved in managing these assets.

The SEC’s decision applies specifically to BNY Mellon’s operations with ETPs, which means this solution might not extend universally across all crypto custody scenarios, the Bloomberg report indicated.

BNY Mellon Expands Crypto Custody Amid Dialogue with SEC and Banking Regulators
The bank is keen on engaging further with the SEC and other banking regulators to expand its crypto custody services. The bank aims to offer these services on a larger scale, indicating a cautious yet optimistic approach towards integrating crypto within traditional financial services.


For banks like BNY Mellon, navigating regulatory landscapes to offer crypto-related services involves ongoing dialogue with multiple regulatory bodies. This latest approval is a key step, but broader regulatory acceptance is still necessary for comprehensive crypto custody services.

BNY Mellon’s move towards Bitcoin and Ether custody, albeit initially limited to ETP clients, marks a significant step. It highlights the evolving relationship between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies, driven by regulatory clarity but also shadowed by ongoing complexities in accounting and oversight.

As banks continue to test these waters, the financial landscape might soon see more integration of digital assets, contingent on regulatory adjustments and bank-specific engagements like that of BNY Mellon.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has settled with TrueCoin and TrustToken, the companies behind TrueUSD stablecoin, for $700,000.

The official release noted that the affiliated backers of the TrueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin allegedly misrepresented the token’s stability, defrauding investors.

Per the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, TrueCoin and TrustToken engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in the form of the crypto asset TUSD. They were also involved in “profit-making opportunities” with respect to TrueUSD from November 2020 until April 2023.

Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the SEC’s crypto unit, emphasised the importance of registration to avoid depriving investors.

“TrueCoin and TrustToken sought profits for themselves by exposing investors to substantial, undisclosed risks through misrepresentations about the safety of the investment.”

SEC Calls TrueUSD as ‘Purported Stablecoin’
The securities regulator called TrueUSD a “purported stablecoin” for falsely marketing the investment opportunity as safe and trustworthy.


According to the complaint, both backers claimed that TUSD was fully backed by U.S. dollars or their equivalent. However, a substantial portion of the asset backing TUSD was invested in a speculative and risky offshore investment fund.

The complaint read that in March 2022, an offshore entity and TrueCoin invested more than half a billion dollars of the assets backing TrueUSD in the speculative fund.

“TrueCoin and TrustToken became aware of redemption problems at the offshore fund but continued to make false statements to investors casting TUSD as backed one-for-one by U.S. dollars.”

Further, by September 2024, 99% of the reserves backing TUSD were invested in the speculative fund.

Both TrueCoin and TrustToken did not deny or admit the SEC’s allegations. They have agreed to settle the regulator’s charges with civil penalties of $163,766 each. Additionally, TrueCoin has agreed to pay a disgorgement of $340,930 with a prejudgment interest of $31,538.

The TrueUSD stablecoin has a market cap of $495 million and has recovered from a slight slump following the news. TUSD is currently trading at $0.99 at press time
Bitcoin price is trading near $64,180 after hitting a high of $64,665, showing a modest pullback. Despite this slight dip, the total crypto market cap remains robust at $2.22 trillion, with only a 0.48% decline in the last 24 hours. Inflows into U.S.-spot Bitcoin ETFs dropped by 1.66% to $397 million.

However, the SEC’s recent approval of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs is seen as a game-changer, likely driving increased institutional interest and reducing counterparty risks, potentially leading to significant upside for Bitcoin holders.

Spot Bitcoin ETF Options Approval; Impact on BTC
The recent approval of options on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. SEC is a pivotal move for institutional Bitcoin adoption.

Jeff Park from Bitwise Invest highlighted that regulated options trading, backed by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), reduces counterparty risks and could lead to increased Bitcoin exposure.

This development opens up new investment opportunities and may drive Bitcoin prices higher.


Moreover, institutional hedging through options is expected to reduce Bitcoin’s market volatility over time.


Although Nasdaq awaits final approvals from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the OCC, analysts believe trading will begin soon, leading to more similar products.

Key Takeaways:

SEC approval enhances institutional adoption and reduces counterparty risk.
Options may lower Bitcoin’s market volatility.
Further regulatory approvals from the CFTC and OCC are expected soon.
These changes position Bitcoin for increased stability and future growth.

Bitcoin Price Outlook – September 25, 2024
Bitcoin is trading at $64,180, experiencing a slight pullback after reaching a high of $64,665. The critical pivot point is $63,780, providing essential support as the price consolidates.

Immediate resistance is $64,665, followed by $65,140 and $65,600. If Bitcoin fails to hold current support, the next levels are $63,310, $63,190, and $62,540.

The RSI is currently at 58, indicating neutral momentum but leaning bullish. The 50-period EMA is at $63,310, serving as crucial short-term support.

A breakout above $64,665 could push Bitcoin higher, while a drop below $63,310 may indicate short-term weakness.

Key Insights:

Immediate Resistance at $64,665, with further targets at $65,140 and $65,600.

Immediate Support at $63,310, with additional levels at $63,190.

RSI at 58 reflects neutral to bullish momentum.

Sky, previously known as Maker, is revisiting its decision to offboard Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) as collateral in its lending protocol.
Decentralized finance pioneer Sky, previously known as Maker, is revisiting its decision to offboard Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) as collateral in its lending protocol.

The reconsideration comes after a new recommendation from its key adviser, BA Labs, following discussions on the Sky governance forum.

On September 24, BA Labs advised halting the WBTC offboarding process.

BitGo Co-Founder Addresses Community Concerns
The recommendation followed an extensive conversation with BitGo co-founder Mike Belshe, who addressed the community’s concerns regarding changes in WBTC’s management and custody.

Belshe clarified BitGo’s commitments, including the control of signing keys and a pledge to provide a minimum of 60 days’ notice before any significant changes.

The 60-day notification standard, according to Belshe, was created by BitGo to ensure transparency and has been consistently adhered to.


He highlighted that these practices aim to maintain the trust and security of WBTC as a decentralized financial instrument.

In light of BitGo’s assurances, BA Labs expressed a more favorable stance toward retaining WBTC as collateral.

BA Labs team member and DAO delegate, known by the pseudonym “monet-supply,” stated that with the current commitments from BitGo and a decrease in WBTC’s exposure to $170 million in total borrowing, the collateral risk has reached a more manageable level.

“While we continue to have concerns about BitGlobal serving as a signer for WBTC, we find it is no longer at a level requiring immediate collateral offboarding,” Monet-supply added.

“Therefore, we recommend indefinitely pausing the collateral offboarding procedures.”

The new recommendation will be put to an executive vote on October 3, potentially reversing a prior decision made on September 19.

The earlier governance vote, which passed with 88% approval, proposed offboarding WBTC collateral through a five-step process beginning in October.

The proposal emerged after BitGo transferred WBTC custody to BitGlobal, a move that sparked significant concerns among the Sky community.

Belshe Claims Coinbase’s cbBTC Introduces More Risk
In response to the community’s concerns, Belshe expressed frustration with the comparison between WBTC and Coinbase’s cbBTC, noting that the latter lacks proof-of-reserves (POR) and could introduce more risk.

“You’re proposing to move all the current WBTC, POR-mitigated risk to CB, when they don’t have POR and have said they won’t ever do it,” Belshe argued.

BA Labs also highlighted the importance of proof of reserves in managing WBTC risks and suggested that Sky compare the potential risks of WBTC against Coinbase’s cbBTC.

Additionally, BA Labs recommended specific adjustments to Sky’s lending parameters, including lowering liquidation penalties, adjusting liquidation ratios, and reducing the liquidation protocol fee for its Legacy Vaults and SparkLend.

The main concern driving this proposal is the involvement of Justin Sun, the founder of Tron.

Last month, BA Labs argued that Sun’s involvement in the new WBTC management structure poses a significant risk to MakerDAO.

At the time, BA Labs suggested that MakerDAO and Spark should consider fully offboarding WBTC unless BitGo and its partners can convincingly demonstrate that the current collateral arrangements remain safe.

Binance Aids India’s Enforcement Directorate in Busting $47.6M Fiewin Gaming Scam
Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has played a pivotal role in assisting India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED) in dismantling a $47.6 million gaming scam linked to the Fiewin app.

The scam involved luring victims into online betting and gaming, promising easy earnings before seizing their funds.

According to a press release shared with Cryptonews.com, Binance’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) provided crucial information that helped trace the funds and expose the fraud network.

Binance Plays Key Role in Uncovering Scam
The ED, India’s primary financial crime investigation agency, revealed that the collaboration with Binance was key in uncovering connections to digital wallets involved in the scam.

“This case showcases the critical importance of collaboration between public institutions like the ED and private entities like Binance in addressing the new types of digital threats,” Ferdinando D., Binance Investigation Specialist working on this case alongside the ED, said.

The ED and Binance have not yet disclosed whether the $47.6 million has been recovered.


The cooperation comes after Binance became one of the few foreign exchanges registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit earlier this year, providing a form of soft recognition in a country where cryptocurrency remains largely unregulated.

In a similar effort last year, Binance and the ED collaborated to freeze millions linked to another gaming app scam, E-Nuggets, as part of a money laundering investigation.

India’s stance on cryptocurrencies has been somewhat ambiguous.

The imposition of strict crypto taxes in 2022 and the crypto market downturn led Indian traders to switch to international exchanges, negatively impacting the local crypto industry.

Trading volumes shifted back to Indian exchanges after the ban on offshore entities, however.

India has made it a priority to achieve global consensus on framing crypto policies as part of its G20 presidency in 2023.

Binance Sees 40% Surge In Institutional Investors
Binance experienced a significant uptick in institutional and corporate investors joining its platform this year.

In an interview with CNBC’s Lin Lin during the Token2049 conference in Singapore, CEO Richard Teng disclosed a 40% increase in such investors throughout 2024.

“Allocation into crypto by institutions is just at the tip of the iceberg,” Teng stated, indicating that the trend is only beginning.

He explained that many institutional investors are still conducting due diligence before fully committing to the crypto space.

Teng, who took over as CEO in November 2023, said the surge in onboarding reflects a growing confidence among big money players towards cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and other digital assets.

It is worth noting that Binance has faced increasing regulatory scrutiny worldwide.

Last year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed charges against Binance for allegedly operating an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange and evading federal laws.

Similarly, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Binance Holdings LTD and ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) for allegedly operating unregistered exchanges, broker exchanges, clearing houses, and the unregistered offer and sale of securities.
French banking giant Societe Generale-FORGE’s crypto subsidiary SG-FORGE has partnered with Bitpanda, to increase access to its EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) stablecoin.

In a joint announcement, the firms said the aim is to increase the adoption of stablecoins across Europe by listing EURCV on Bitpanda’s broker platform, making it available to more investors.

The stablecoin is fully backed by Euros issued on the Ethereum public blockchain and complies with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations.

Move to Increase Digital Asset Adoption in Europe
SG-FORGE said that its partnership with Bitpanda reflects a shared commitment to advance the use of digital assets, particularly stablecoins in Europe.

In December, the French bank listed its stablecoin, EURCV CoinVertible, on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp crypto exchange.

“We are committed to offering European users a stable, secure, and accessible digital asset for trading, settlement, and store of value,” said Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-FORGE in a statement.


With the use of Bitpanda’s infrastructure, EURCV will be used in daily transactions, cross-border payments, and remittances across Europe.

Stablecoins give the advantage of price stability allowing users to participate in the digital economy without the volatility typically associated with cryptocurrencies.
Assetera, a blockchain-based investment and trading firm, has partnered with Polygon to launch Europe’s first regulated marketplace for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).

The platform will enable the trading of tokenized securities, funds, and money market instruments in a secure and efficient digital environment.

Assetera will use Polygon’s Ethereum scaling network to provide fast and cost-effective transactions, while using stablecoins for purchase, clearing, and settlement processes.

Assetera is Regulated Under MiFID II
The Austrian firm is already regulated under the MiFID II framework and holds a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license.

It is now preparing to comply with the upcoming Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations, which will allow it to expand its services across the European Union.

The platform is accessible to both retail and professional investors, reflecting a growing trend in the tokenization of traditional financial assets like bonds and commodities.


The process, which brings traditional assets onto the blockchain, promises increased speed and transparency in trading.


MiFID II does not offer a clear definition of a financial instrument but instead provides examples, leaving the specifics to be determined by individual countries.

In April, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) issued a consultative document to address this ambiguity.

In a collaborative effort in July, ESMA joined forces with the European Banking Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority to revisit the classification of crypto assets.

Meanwhile, provisions under the MiCA regulation concerning stablecoins took effect on July 1, preceding other aspects of the regulatory framework.

This resulted in an immediate reshuffling of the market, with non-compliant stablecoins being restricted in Europe and new, compliant stablecoins being introduced.

Tokenized Asset Market Could Reach $1.3T by 2030
Some in the crypto community have cast doubt on a recent projection suggesting that tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could reach a staggering $30 trillion by 2030.

Among the critics is Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Real Vision, who believes that a more realistic valuation is closer to $1.3 trillion.

Coutts pointed out that if the current compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 121% for tokenized assets continues, the market could indeed reach $1.3 trillion by 2030.

Coutts’ cautious outlook is echoed by other industry experts.

McKinsey & Company recently reported that tokenized financial assets have had a “cold start” but are still expected to grow to a $2 trillion market by 2030.

Meanwhile, a report by the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) and Boston Consulting Group estimates the global value of tokenized illiquid assets will reach $16 trillion by 2030.

Even more conservative estimates from Citigroup suggest that $4 trillion to $5 trillion worth of tokenized digital securities could be minted by 2030.

Recognizing this potential, major companies are making significant moves in the tokenization space.

Goldman Sachs, for instance, plans to launch three new tokenization products later this year, driven by growing client interest.

Cardano Price Forecast: ADA Jumps 15% Ahead of Hoskinson’s Meeting with Argentine President.
The Cardano price has risen by 3.5% in the past 24 hours, reaching $0.3828 on a day when the crypto market as a whole has dipped by 1%.

ADA is now up by 16% in a week and by 14% in a fortnight, with the coin benefitting from the recent news that Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson is likely to meet Argentina’s President Javier Milei in October.

Given Cardano’s existing presence in Argentina, the fact that both Hoskinson and Milei will be attending the same conference invites the belief that Cardano could soon gain more traction within the South American nation.

And because ADA has traded below its fair price for too long now, any significant adoption could see its price rocket.

Cardano Price Forecast: ADA Jumps 15% Ahead of Hoskinson’s Meeting with Argentine President
As we reported last week, Hoskinson’s expects to meet with Milei at the tech conference in October, and to discuss how blockchain adoption could further economic change.

While the meeting is not 100% confirmed for the event, Hoskinson expects it to happen sooner or later, and it could provide a very significant opportunity for Cardano.


The latter had already signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the province of Entre Ríos, with which it will work on boosting blockchain adoption in its area.

As such, it is credible to believe that Cardano will deepen its ties in Argentina, with this expectation helping to boost ADA’s price over the past week.

Even now, ADA’s chart continues to show considerable momentum, with the alt’s RSI (purple) remaining above 50.

Cardano price chart.
Source: TradingView
It also looks as though the Cardano price is about to bounce off its support level (green), sending it towards $0.39 and potentially $0.40 in the next few days.

Now may therefore be a good time to buy ADA, at a time when it’s beginning to show renewed impetus but is still well below what many would regard as a fair price.

Indeed, it’s currently 87% below its all-time high of $3.09, which it recorded in September 2021.

It therefore has plenty of catching up to do, with Cardano’s fundamentals suggesting that it should recover strongly sooner or later.


For example, there are now over 1,300 projects developing applications and platforms on Cardano, with the blockchain having a total value of $212 million.

And when combined with the upcoming Chang hard fork (which brings zero-knowledge proofs to its network), the Cardano price could rise strongly in the next few weeks and months.

It may hit $0.50 by the end of October, before ending the year at around $1.

New Altcoins with Strong Potential
While ADA remains a dark horse in the cryptocurrency market, traders in pursuit of bigger and faster gains may find more success with newer alternatives.

While the market is awash with thousands of low-quality coins, one way of identifying more promising new tokens is to look for popular presales.

And one coin having a strong sale right now is DICE, the Solana-based native token of online casino Mega Dice.

It has now raised $1.8 million in its token offering, which will end in just over four days.


Mega Dice has had such a successful sale because it’s already one of the cryptocurrency sector’s biggest casinos, having launched in 2023.

As of writing, its website offers a big sportsbook and over 4,500 games, including classic casino staples and a wide variety of virtual slots.

Its new native token, DICE, will serve as the payment token within its platform, while also offering access to exclusive games and bonuses.

It has a max supply of 420 million tokens, with holders be able to stake the token for a passive income.

The combination of utility and staking should mean that DICE experiences significant demand, pushing its price up over time.


While its sale will end very soon, latecomers can still buy it a lower sale price by going to the Mega Dice website.

The coin is currently available at $0.116056 per token, with DICE likely to eclipse this price once it lists on trading platforms next week.

It will begin by listing on Solana-based DEX Raydium, with more listings likely to follow soon after.

Binance Unveils Unique Pre-Market Spot Trading for Actual Tokens, Leading the Industry
Binance has introduced a new pre-market spot trading service, setting itself apart as the first crypto exchange to offer trading of actual tokens prior to their official spot market listing.

In a Wednesday press release, the exchange said the new service would allow its users to gain early exposure to new tokens, enhancing their trading strategies.

“We built Binance Pre-Market to meet user demand for pre-market spot trading, and enhance the Binance ecosystem so users can enjoy greater utility and token projects can extend their lifecycle on our platform,” Vishal Sacheendran, Binance Head of Regional Markets, said.

Binance’s Pre-Market Service Differentiates from Rivals
Unlike other exchanges that provide pre-market trading primarily through derivatives, Binance’s service offers real tokens for users to hold and trade during the pre-market phase.

This initiative distinguishes Binance from competitors such as Bybit and Coinbase.

Bybit, for instance, offers a pre-market spot trading service that relies on derivatives.


According to Bybit’s website, users must collateralize their assets in USDT as a guarantee for settlement, indicating that they are not dealing with actual tokens during the pre-market period.


Meanwhile, Coinbase International’s “pre-launch markets” service involves trading perpetual futures contracts for tokens yet to be launched, which convert into standard perpetual futures once the tokens are listed on spot exchanges.

The Binance Pre-Market service is a collaborative effort between Binance Spot and Binance Launchpool, a platform allowing users to earn new project tokens by staking other cryptocurrencies.

Only selected Launchpool tokens will be eligible for pre-market trading.

Currently, these tokens are held until the official spot listing, but the new service will enable users to trade them immediately, albeit with restrictions on withdrawals, transfers, and deposits until the official listing.

Binance will announce when a Launchpool project becomes available for pre-market trading, including its start date.

Once pre-market trading begins, all Binance users can trade the “pre-market” tagged tokens.

The pre-market period will conclude at least four hours before the official spot trading, with a separate announcement for the listing.

However, the service is not available in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S., Canada, Dubai, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia, and Spain, due to regulatory restrictions.

Cybersecurity researchers are using automated email replies to compromise systems and deliver stealthy crypto mining malware.

According to a report by the threat intelligence firm Facct, hackers have been leveraging auto-reply emails from compromised accounts to target organizations in Russia, including companies, marketplaces, and financial institutions.

The attackers aim to install the XMRig miner on victims’ devices, enabling them to mine digital assets covertly.

150 Emails Containing XMRig Miner Identified
Facct’s investigation revealed that since late May, approximately 150 emails containing the XMRig miner were identified.

However, the firm’s business email protection system successfully blocked these malicious emails before they could reach their clients.

Dmitry Eremenko, a senior analyst at Facct, highlighted the unique danger posed by this attack vector.


Unlike typical mass phishing campaigns where potential victims can easily ignore suspicious emails, this method preys on the expectations of recipients.


Since the victims initiate the communication by sending an email first, they are more likely to trust the auto-reply they receive, unaware that the email account they contacted is compromised.

“In this scenario, even if the email doesn’t appear convincing, the established communication chain may reduce suspicion, making the recipient more likely to engage with the malicious attachment.”

Facct urged organizations to enhance their cybersecurity measures by regularly training employees on current threats and best practices.

They also recommended the use of strong passwords and multi-factor authentication to safeguard against such attacks.

This is not the first time hackers have employed XMRig in their operations.

XMRig, an open-source application designed to mine the Monero cryptocurrency, has been frequently integrated into malicious campaigns since 2020.

In June 2020, a malware dubbed “Lucifer” exploited outdated Windows vulnerabilities to deploy XMRig.

Later, in August 2020, a botnet named “FritzFrog” targeted millions of IP addresses, including government offices and financial institutions, to distribute the crypto mining software.

North Korean Hackers Use Malware to Steal Crypto Keys
Earlier this month, the FBI issued a warning about a sophisticated new Android malware called SpyAgent, discovered by McAfee, which is designed to steal cryptocurrency private keys from users’ smartphones.

SpyAgent targets private keys by leveraging optical character recognition (OCR) technology to scan and extract text from screenshots and images stored on the device.

The malware is distributed through malicious links sent via text messages.

The alert came on the heels of another malware threat identified in August.

The “Cthulhu Stealer,” which affects MacOS systems, similarly disguises itself as legitimate software and targets personal information, including MetaMask passwords, IP addresses, and cold wallet private keys.

The same month saw Microsoft uncover a vulnerability in Google Chrome, which North Korean hacker group Citrine Sleet exploited to create fake cryptocurrency exchanges and fraudulent job applications.

As reported, August saw a surge in crypto-related scams, with a staggering $310 million lost to various exploits, making it the second-highest monthly total this year.

Ether.fi Thwarts Domain Takeover Attempt, User Funds Remain Safe
Ether.fi, a liquid restaking protocol, narrowly avoided a security scare after attackers attempted to hijack its domain name through its registrar, Gandi.net.

According to a detailed post by Ether.fi, the incident unfolded on Sept. 24 when the team received an email notification from Gandi indicating a domain recovery request. This triggered the protocol’s existing security measures, including verifying email sender authentication (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC), which ultimately alerted them to a potential attack.

Ether.fi contacted Gandi across multiple platforms, leading to a successful lockdown of their domain account by 7:30 PM UTC. This prevented further tampering and ensured the integrity of their nameserver configuration.

“We are in contact with our domain provider and the domain is locked down. Please continue to avoid our site until we have verified everything is working as expected,” Ether.fi said on its social media.

The company’s X post emphasizes that no internal breach has been detected, and user funds remain safe.


Proactive Approach and Collaboration
Ether.fi credits its proactive approach – including requiring hardware authentication for key platforms – for mitigating the attack and also highlights the importance of domain registrar security practices. “Gandi’s monitoring systems and process, while aggressive, locked down the domain account and prevented any access to our systems, and kept our websites, apps and emails safe from the attempted attack.”

While the full picture remains under investigation, Ether.fi promises further details in collaboration with Gandi within the next two days.

DeFi Under Attack: Recent Security Incidents Raise Concerns
The Ether.fi domain takeover attempt is just one example of the growing number of security incidents affecting the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. In recent weeks, several other DeFi projects have fallen victim to attacks, highlighting the ongoing challenges in safeguarding user funds and data.

An example is the Ethena website exploit that occurred in September. Ethena Labs, the company behind the synthetic dollar protocol, warned users to avoid interacting with any site or application claiming to be Ethena. According to its X post from Sept. 18, the site’s domain registrar account was compromised, resulting in the temporary shutdown of the site. Despite the exploit, Ethena Labs assured users that the underlying protocol and their funds remained unaffected.


Another high-profile incident involved the Telegram-based cryptocurrency trading bot Banana Gun. This bot allows users to trade on popular blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Base. However, on Sept. 19, attackers exploited vulnerabilities in the bot’s code to drain nearly $2 million worth of digital assets from unsuspecting users. Security firm Cyvers identified at least 11 attackers responsible for these thefts.

Visa Creates Platform to Aid Banks in Issuing Fiat-Backed Tokens
Visa has launched a new platform to support financial institutions in issuing fiat-backed tokens, positioning itself at the forefront of blockchain integration in banking.

Visa’s crypto division, led by Cuy Sheffield, is guiding banks to adopt this new infrastructure. Realizing that banks can modernize their financial systems if offered fiat-backed tokens and engage in on-chain capital markets.

Visa’s platform has then set forth to enable the transition from traditional financial infrastructure to blockchain-powered digital systems.

Visa in Web3: The New Blockchain Fiat-Back Tokens
Visa has been closely watching the evolution of tokenization, particularly as central banks and commercial financial institutions seek to modernize payment and settlement systems.

According to Sheffield, Visa’s new Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) will allow banks to explore these technologies in a regulated environment.

Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), one of the participating banks, is already testing, with plans to launch a pilot on the Ethereum blockchain in 2025.


Similarly, in Hong Kong where Visa has been exploring the use of tokenized deposits for cross-border settlement of tokenized securities


While fintech companies like PayPal have been at the forefront of stablecoin innovation, Visa’s push signals that large financial institutions are now ready to experiment with blockchain technologies.

Visa aims to help them navigate regulatory compliance’s complexities while unlocking new liquidity and real-time money movement opportunities.

Visa executives have identified real-time money transfers and cross-border payments as key use cases for fiat-backed tokens.

Banks could leverage these tokens to move money between clients seamlessly, similar to JPMorgan’s JPM Coin System, which functions as a permissioned payment rail.

Real-World Applications for Banks
In regions where central banks are developing wholesale CBDCs, banks could also use fiat-backed tokens to facilitate inter-bank transfers, further enhancing the efficiency of financial transactions.

According to Catherine Gu, Visa’s head of CBDC and tokenized assets, cross-border transfers are a major area of focus. She said;

“For especially multinational corporates moving money 24/7, right now the rails are very limited for them to do so,”

Blockchain offers a solution by allowing faster, more efficient transactions, which is why major banks are keen to explore this use case.

Banks could now provide clients a more streamlined, round-the-clock money movement solution.

Interacting with tokenized real-world assets is another area that Visa believes will drive significant demand for fiat-backed tokens.

Banks could enable customers to use these tokens to purchase tokenized commodities or government securities, with blockchain technology enabling instant settlement.

Sheffield also highlighted the potential for banks to use smart contracts to create structured financial products, such as lending against tokenized commodities automatically through smart contracts.

Despite the opportunities, Visa acknowledges that challenges remain, particularly regarding the fragmentation of tokenization platforms.

Different financial institutions may choose to operate on various public and private blockchains, depending on their use cases and regulatory environments.

This lack of uniformity poses a significant hurdle to widespread adoption, as it complicates interactions between institutions.

Visa is working to address these issues by promoting global standards for blockchain-based financial services, ensuring that financial institutions can operate efficiently across different blockchain networks.

Notably, Visa has been at the forefront of the industry’s innovative adoption in Banking.

Earlier this year, Visa partnered with Transak, a Web3 infrastructure provider, to enhance cryptocurrency adoption by enabling users to convert crypto to fiat currencies directly through Visa debit cards.

This integration uses Visa Direct, which allows real-time withdrawals from wallets like MetaMask and allows users to spend crypto balances at over 130 million merchant locations.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Pushes Above $66K After Soft US Inflation - Here’s Where Its Headed Next

Things are starting to look good in the DeFi market again as top coins like Ethereum (ETH) are back in their bullish state. In a recent turn of events, some ETH whales sold off their investments and subsequently drove up the price of the token by a long shot. This surge has convinced analysts that ETH will touch the $2,700 mark any time now.

Amid this backdrop, a new promising PropFi token called FXGuys ($FXG) has caught the attention of of some investors.

FXGuys ($FXG) Token Presale
Ethereum Rallies Due to New Whale Activity
A couple of ETH whales have started taking advantage of the windfall from the general profit rally happening across the DeFi market.

One such whale reportedly deposited 10,000 ETH valued at $24 million into the Kraken Exchange on September 18, 2024, after two years of inactivity while having participated in the ETH ICO. This whale initially received 50,000 Ethereum in the ICO, now valued at approximately $121.85 million from its initial approximate value of $15,500.

In another notable transaction, a different whale sold 10,595 ETH for the value of $24.79 million within three days. The whale now retains a balance of 6,042 ETH, estimated to be worth approximately $14.7 million.

Surprisingly enough, the price of Ethereum has since jumped by 5.3% from its closing price of $2,341.71 on September 17, which was the day before the sell-offs happened.

Going by the increased market activity these whale accounts are generating for Ethereum, many analysts are predicting that it won’t be long before ETH crosses the $2700 mark.

Level Up with FXGuys’ Top-Notch PropFi Platform
With the PropFi features it offers, FXGuys has aims to become one of the biggest crypto platforms in the market. FXGuys was an idea for creating a community-driven project to be used for the world’s first Forex Trader Development Ecosystem. This plan is to establish a decentralized trading brokerage later.

Operating on the Ethereum network, FXGuys boasts an exceptional analytics platform with social trading and funding programs that share their profits with ace traders.

For every trade a user makes, $FXG tokens are given through the Trade2Earn model catered by FXGuys. As more and more traders flock to FXGuys, so does the demand for the token; hence, its value rises. Depending on the volume of trading, $FXG tokens will be directly credited to the users’ wallets, regardless of the outcome of the trades.

Benefits of this Trade2Earn model include lowered profit targets and increased drawdown limits that traders can utilize with their $FXG tokens. Most importantly, FXGuys only takes 20% of the $FXG profits and distributes 80% back to the traders.

The new PropFi platform offers up to $200,000 in trading capital for aspiring traders to manage. What’s more, traders are in a position to scale up their accounts.

Buy Your $FXG Tokens Before It’s Too Late!
$FXG is currently in presale mode, with one token priced at $0.03. FXGuys is committed to incorporating DeFi, adding transparency, crypto payments capability, and special rewards for better trading experiences.

The crypto market is always in constant flux, and investors are looking for the next huge project, Rexas Finance (RXS) is quickly catching the public’s attention despite only being in a presale. Of late, the emerging convergence of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi) has made Rexas Finance a platform that could experience significant growth soon.

Rexas Finance: The Smooth Transition to RWA Token Business
Rexas Finance offers a platform for RWA tokenization. Owning an equity stake in low-cost real estate via Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) gives average investors opportunities otherwise closed to them. With this model, Rexas Finance can disrupt the financing market as it reduces barriers to entry for ordinary users and improves liquidity.

A notable highlight of Rexas Finance is the presence of an elaborate ecosystem that aims to improve the process of asset tokenization. It provides instruments like the Rexas Token Builder, which makes creating and operating digital assets more convenient. Moreover, these features are also integrated with advanced AIs such as GenAI and AI Shield, which bring on board even more tools, making the process seamless for retail and applicability considering institutional investors.

Bias of Big Players Interested In Crypto Currency
Rexas Finance’s presale has attracted institutional and retail investors alike, with some high-profile names coming into play as well. Most of them state that they are attracted to the project because of the platform’s ability to enhance the existing financial markets and are impressed with Rexas’ use cases, which many believe will enable growth potential in the future.

The fact that the token is currently selling for just $0.05 per token has brought numerous investors to the presale. Early backers stated that they mainly invested in the platform because it seeks to solve real-world problems. The markets, which are usually out of reach, are made transparently more affordable in terms of operational costs, as well as more liquid by offering tokenization services.

Join Rexas Finance ($RXS) Presale 
Market Potential and Expansion Plans
If the current success of the RXS token presale continues, the project will be very well off, both in terms of the number of backers and in terms of price. As the trend of tokenized assets matures into everyday use assets, Rexas Finance aims to ride the tokenization wave and grow in user numbers.


Moreover, it has been noted that one of the reasons Rexas Finance is receiving a lot of attention from investors is its scalability prospective plans. The project has also enunciated further growth plans through continuous improvement of asset tokenization, use of DeFi tools, and strengthening existing collaborations with traditional financial partners. These strategic moves are likely to open up more institutional participants, thereby increasing the value of the token and the market share of the platform.

Tokenomics and Presale Progress
As mentioned before, the Rexas Finance presale has been quite successful so far; Stage 1 itself sold out in under three days. Since stage 1 of the presale closed at $0.03, stage 2’s presale price of $0.04 generated further interest as early investors realized how much price-value they could get during the presale’s early stages. The project’s presale is currently in the third stage, with RXS tokens being sold at the price of $0.05. The project has currently raised $1.6 million.

Since most changes have been on the tokenomics side of Rexas Finance, the platform’s arrangement aims to promote healthy supply against demand, which is crucial for the longevity of the growth and price stability. At each phase of the presale, the price of each RXS token tends to increase, which serves to encourage members to join early. A lot of speculation is directed at Rexas Finance, with many investors wondering about the degree of its potential growth after its launch, especially now that it has major investors backing it. More so, the growing interest, especially towards the token with a capped supply, ensures that Rexas Finance bulks up for a good performance when it is fully rolled out to the market.

A Bright Future Ahead for Rexas Finance
Rexas Finance has—in a very short time—established itself as one of the most loved and talked about presales in the world of RWA, and for a good reason. There is no collection outside of Rexas Finance that focuses on the tokenization of real-world assets that experienced this degree of major industry name support.

The team at Rexas Finance has its sights set on ranking within the top 10 within the next six months. With an increasing number of investors envisioning Rexas Finance as a game changer in the finance industry, they expect the growth of the platform to gain further momentum.
To those who trade in cryptocurrency, the latest trends in any coin are always a concern, and therefore, they are likely to understand the rise of Rexas Finance (RXS). Priced at only $0.05, this new cryptocurrency could give Cardano (ADA) a run for its money.

Let’s examine what makes Rexas Finance so hot and why this altcoin could hit the $12 mark in 2025.

What is Rexas Finance (RXS)?
Rexas Finance is a whole new vision, and it’s not just a conventional cryptocurrency. Tokenization in Rexas Finance focuses on the concept of real-world assets (RWA).

Rexas Finance gives users access to RWA letting crypto enthusiasts invest in a matter of minutes – meaning retail investors can purchase fractions of real-world assets that previously only belonged to the rich and famous.

Why Rexas Finance is Trending as a Cardano (ADA) Competitor
For a long time, Cardano has been focused on security, scalability, and the development of its blockchain technology. Nevertheless, Rexas Finance is entering the stage, which has the same vision but with a twist. Because of its emphasis on the use of technological developments to capture real estate assets through tokenization, Rexas aims to exploit a market niche that Cardano has not completely ventured into.

Cardano is sure to cultivate a brand and there is still room for users, but its emphasis is mainly on creating a secure and viable blockchain ecosystem. Rexas Finance, taking a different approach, seeks to revolutionize the way real estate, commodities, and even art are traded, bought, and sold. This has raised eyebrows among analysts and investors alike who are forecasting that Rexas might be the next big threat to ADA if they continue in this business.

The Evolution of Rexas Finance (RXS)
As it stands, Rexas Finance is at its second-stage presale, priced at $0.05, after a 66% jump from the first-stage, which was priced at $0.030. It is currently in the third stage of a presale.


However, the buzz surrounding this altcoin has not decreased, as it will launch at a value of $0.20 in early 2025. Here comes the fun part, analysts are estimating that RXS could potentially reach a price level of $12 in Q1, 2025.

What Fuels the Rexas Finance Price Hike?
There is a range of underlying drivers of the strong growth expectations of Rexas Finance.

Real-world utility: By taking an asset-tokenization approach, Rexas has found its way into a market that is not a dead-end for small and also for institutional investors.
Community reception is favorable: Rexas Finance has nurtured a population of early adopters and fans of cryptocurrency who are all caught in the excitement brought about by the looking-forward aspects of the platform.
Decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins, and altcoins have found a home in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.

MENA is the seventh-largest crypto market globally this year.

Between July 2023 and June 2024, its on-chain value was $338.7 billion, or 7.5% of the world’s total transaction volume.


Source: Chainalysis
According to its latest ‘2024 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report,’ MENA’s primary source of crypto inflows is still centralized exchanges (CEXs).

However, “decentralized platforms and DeFi applications are steadily gaining traction,” the researchers said.

DeFi has a multitude of benefits for the region. It fosters innovation and provides an alternative financial system for the unbanked and underbanked.


Moreover, it does not require any intermediaries, which is crucial for people in underserved areas.

All these factors are key for financial inclusion, given that, as of 2021, only 50% of adults in the region (excluding high-income countries) had a bank account.

DeFi adoption is not widespread in some of these areas, but these benefits “could drive future financial inclusion.” Individuals gain the ability to access savings, loans, and investment tools.


Notably, Saudi Arabia and the UAE demonstrate high interest in decentralized platforms.

Particularly, the UAE shows higher DeFi adoption than the global average. It has seen “rapid growth,” boasting a diversified crypto ecosystem.

This is the result of regulatory innovation, institutional interest, and expanding market activity, said the report.


Source: Chainalysis
Between July 2023 and June 2024, the UAE received over $30 billion in crypto, making it MENA’s third-largest crypto economy and one of the top 40 worldwide.

DeFi services saw the total value increase by 74% compared to last year.

DEXs alone recorded an 87% value increase from an estimated $6 billion to $11.3 billion.

Regulatory strides made across key markets in 2024 are “likely to further shape the distribution of DeFi and CEX platforms, impacting financial inclusion and the broader adoption” of DeFi, the report said.

Stablecoins and Altcoins Make Significant Gains Across MENA
Stablecoins and altcoins are gaining market share in MENA over “traditionally preferred assets” like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the report remarked.

Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE have recorded higher shares of stablecoin volume.

In the UAE, the Emirati dirham is pegged to the US dollar. Therefore, the rising stablecoin adoption “likely reflects their popularity as an on-ramp to broader crypto services and trading.”


Source: Chainalysis
On the other hand, in Türkiye, retail users rely on stablecoins due to economic instability, high inflation, volatility concerns, and a need for consistent stores of value.

Researchers have noted that individuals have turned to stablecoins and altcoins to hedge against currency devaluation and seek higher returns.

“Türkiye is number one in the world in stablecoin trading volume as a percentage of GDP, by a large margin,” the report said. “Stablecoins consistently represent the majority of crypto assets purchased with the Turkish Lira, approaching nearly $6 billion in purchases in March of this year.”

Additionally, Türkiye is the largest crypto market in MENA and seventh globally. It received $136.8 billion in value between July 2023 and June 2024.


Source: Chainalysis
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia shows “a strong interest in altcoins, well above the global average.”

This may indicate a higher risk appetite and interest in assets beyond the major coins.

Speaking of major coins, the use of ETH in the region is “relatively consistent.” However, it “falls below the global average.” Türkiye leads this engagement, the research concluded.

Pepe Coin, one of the most popular meme coins found today, was launched just over a year ago and is based on the famous frog meme, which wears different emotions. While the coin performed well at the outset, it had recently begun to experience price stagnation. One of the fairly recent up-and-coming rivals, Rexas Finance (RXS), displays great potential with its utility-based approach.

The Rise and Struggles of PEPE Coin
One of the main reasons investors are attracted to Pepe is its deflationary nature. A certain percentage of Pepe coins gets burned with each transaction, effectively increasing the value of the rest of the tokens over the long run. However, PEPE, like many other meme coins, has its value drawn by speculation to a degree.

After a period of price growth and high volatility, PEPE is now experiencing price stagnation. Despite having a lot of followers, recently, it has not kept up with the pace of other new emerging cryptos. Market volatility and investor hesitation, alongside other meme and utility token competition, have hammered down on its recent ascent.

Rexas Finance (RXS): The Pepe Coin Rival
Rexas Finance (RXS) has been making headlines as an emerging rival to Pepe Coin, which has had its fair share of bumps. Rexas Finance states that it takes a more serious approach to utility, promising to be a disruptive force in the digital assets market. The project’s aim is the tokenization of virtually any form of asset one has, whether it is real estate, art, modes of production, or intellectual property. In simple words, by way of the issuance of tokens, Rexas enables users to invest in assets beyond their geographical boundaries.

This new workable model empowers people to own portions of “high-value” assets no matter the value of one’s investments increasing the ease of investment, liquidity as well as security.

Rexas Finance ($RXS) token presale is going on now.
A Strong Start for Rexas Finance (RXS): The Opening Presale Success
At the moment, RXS is still in the third phase of its presale, with the first two stages demonstrating that the project is far from all talk. The first presale stage accomplished the release of 15,000,000 RXS tokens at $0.03 each which generated $450,000 in less than 3 days. Stage 2 of the presale also sold out, with tokens priced at $0.04 per token and 20,000,000 tokens allocated. This rapid progress indicates a strong demand for RXS.


As anticipation keeps on surging, Rexas Finance is giving away $1 million, split between 20 participants. This campaign has already garnered over 67,000 participants. With 134 days remaining in the contest, the community of the platform keeps growing which indicates that the project has financial uptake but also a lot of active users.

A Utility-Based Project Primed for Growth
Rexas Finance’s business model, with emphasis on leadership in the tokenization of assets, is certainly a differentiating feature against other hype-driven coins. While meme coins such as Pepe get most of their value from internet trends and speculation, Rexas attempts to do so by displaying utility.

Demand for utility-based types of assets is projected to be considerably higher since institutions and retail investors tend to invest in such projects in the long term.

With the presale already exceeding Rexas’ expectations and capturing the attention of the audience, investors are expecting a bright future for the project. Should Rexas Finance hold its ground and continue delivering on the expectations, the early investors will reap handsomely as the token positions itself in the highly competitive digital asset market.

Conclusion
Despite establishing itself in the niche of meme coins with the PEPE Coin, recent woes have provided some breathing space for rivals, one of them being Rexas Finance.

Currently, in its presale, the token is priced at $0.05. The project has raised $1.6 million, with the presale being only in its 3rd stage.
The new cryptocurrency Rexas Finance ($RXS), currently priced at $0.05 in its presale stage, shows the potential to offer notable opportunities in the blockchain space. Solana (SOL) experienced an impressive rise in 2021, growing from $0.50 to become a major player in the crypto market.

Rexas Finance attempts to mirror this price increase by providing a unique platform that allows users to tokenize and own real-world assets, such as real estate and intellectual property, on a global scale. By leveraging blockchain technology, Rexas Finance aims to enhance asset liquidity and create more transparent, efficient, and inclusive investment opportunities for its users.

Rexas Finance Ecosystem

How Truflation’s Decentralized Data is Benefiting DeFi Developers

Blocks being added to a blockchain
Access to reliable real-time data is vital for DeFi developers tasked with building the next wave of novel financial products. This is why the blockchain oracle market has grown tremendously in recent years, with the demand for providers’ services seemingly on a neverending climb.

By bridging real-world data to blockchain networks, oracles enable smart contracts to execute actions based on off-chain inputs, like equipping an old computer with high-speed internet access.

There are certainly many players active in the Oracle market, but one has been turning heads of late due to its use of decentralized data to manage inflation risk. Since its emergence in mid-2021, Truflation has brought on-chain data delivery to the worlds of TradFi and DeFi, giving builders the tools they need to create cutting-edge finance solutions. So, what’s the new tool, and how might it be useful?

DeFi’s Need for Decentralized Data
Before we get onto the new tool, here is a word about the platform’s central pillar – the Truflation Stream Network (TSN). An independent, transparent, and censorship-resistant oracle that furnishes DeFi developers with a reliable source of real-time data, the TSN has been a godsend for countless on-chain protocols that need accurate, up-to-date, and untampered information in order to function effectively and maintain user trust.

Centralized data sources are popularly known to fall short of meeting these requirements. For this reason, the TSN operates as a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN), complete with globally distributed data providers, node operators, and data scientists. As for the data gathered by this DePIN, it includes info related to perpetual markets, lending protocols, prediction markets, and synthetic assets.

Truflation has long been on a mission to become “the definitive reference point” for indexes and inflation data, its dashboards providing access to over 18 million data points from 65 providers. These dashboards – as the numbers indicate – offer an unprecedented depth of information, including dedicated screens for calculating inflation in several different countries.


The rate of inflation, of course, is an ever-present concern for investors – and not only because it impacts their purchasing power; it also cheapens the value of real-world investments. Truflation’s latest innovation is its RWA Hedge Index, a tool that enables the tracking of real-world assets and provides a way to aggregate their performance over time.

Designed to mitigate potential losses from inflation, the new index tracks price movements across five core asset classes, namely equities, precious metals, commodities, and currencies. Its composition is weighted with gold (25%), silver (20%), WTI Crude Oil (20%), S&P 500 (25%), and Bitcoin (10%), a diverse mix that provides something of an overview of the main asset classes. CEO Stefan Rust has dubbed it “a game-changer for investors seeking to protect their portfolios against inflation.”

In an era of elevated inflation and growing interest in RWAs, the arrival of the index is certainly timely. A recent report published by Binance Research suggests around $12 billion worth of RWAs have already been tokenized. By providing accurate pricing for a wide range of them, Truflation makes it easy for investors and DeFi devs to build the protocols they use to gauge RWAs’ usefulness as hedges against the US dollar. It’s a capability that opens up fresh avenues for creating financial instruments that bridge the gap between TradFi and DeFi.

This work is well underway: Truflation’s decentralized data feeds are already leveraged by several prominent DeFi protocols focused on RWA tokenization, including Nuon Finance, Frax Finance, and Overlay Protocol.

Cutting Through the Noise
In an increasingly complex financial landscape, where traditional economic indicators rarely tell the whole story, Truflation’s transparent approach to data delivery stands out. For DeFi devs seeking to deliver for users, tapping into the platform’s decentralized data – or that of another dependable oracle provider – is a no-brainer.

Expect the RWA market to continue to attract interest and inflation to remain a subject of constant fierce debate. Truflation’s latest innovations, particularly its RWA Hedge Index, represents a mighty tool for DeFi developers looking to cut through the noise.

Why Trust Cryptonews


The $SUI token underpinning the Layer 1 SUI network is closing on a new all-time high (ATH) today, while the similarly named $SEI from the Sei protocol is the best-performing Layer 1 token this week.

In the last 24 hours, $SUI added 8% to trade at $1.73.

The Sui Network token blew up an eye-watering 45% over the last seven days, which makes it the week’s second fastest-growing cryptocurrency among the seventy-five largest layer 1 projects after Sei’s $SEI, which added 73.5% over the week and currently trades at $0.4654.

Sui and Sei Price Analysis: Where Are The Layer 1s Heading Next?
Like Solana and Ethereum, Sui Network deploys high-functionality smart contracts, enabling developers to build a world of decentralized applications (dApps) offering services from financial services to gaming.

Sui processes transactions a lot faster than Ethereum. While Ethereum has a maximum theoretical throughput of 119 transactions per second (tps), Sui’s developers say it is capable of achieving a staggering 297,000, thanks to its ability to process transactions simultaneously.

Despite its promise, Sui Network’s support level had been falling steadily throughout the year-to-date and was dragged down significantly by the crypto crash on August 5th.


Since then, the token has successfully recaptured the psychologically important $1.50 mark, however, a falling relative strength index (RSI) of 45 indicates selling momentum could consolidate the token at its current level, which will give it a base to claim a new ATH.

Sui Network ($SUI) last set an ATH of $2.17 on March 27 this year. At today’s price, it’s 21% short of setting a new high watermark.


Meanwhile, $SEI, the token underpinning an eponymous Layer 1 protocol that provides infrastructure for building decentralized exchanges (DEXs), has had a more volatile upward trajectory since the August crash.

A steep vertical ascent in the last 24 hours indicates a possible whale purchase has artificially inflated $SEI’s price. Its relative strength index is 73 and falling, indicating an overbought asset. This means the rally is likely to cool off as traders cash in recent gains.


Beyond Layer 1s: The Dawn of Solana Casinos
To invest in layer 1 tokens like Sui and Sei is to play the long game. For the most part, their price movements follow Bitcoin’s, except on rare weeks like this when they lead.

That’s because it takes time for Layer 1 networks to cultivate the talent, funds, tech and products, to be able to compete with stalwarts like Ethereum and Solana.

However, one such sector that could see more immediate flourishing is GambleFi, which operates at the intersection of two emerging markets: Web3 and online casinos.

Perhaps the most exciting upcoming gamblefi project is Mega Dice ($DICE), a crypto casino token that has raked in $1.9 million so far in its ongoing ICO.

Mega Dice launched last year as the world’s first licensed crypto casino accessible through the popular messaging app Telegram and has since attracted 50,000 players.

Others followed suit and launched iGaming bots on Telegram, most notably TG Casino.

Mega Dice’s new $DICE turbocharges the online casino’s services to a whole new level.

As the platform’s native utility token, players can use $DICE to fund games and receive payment, with some games requiring it.


$DICE is also integrated into the casino’s loyalty program, offering more generous rewards and exclusive competitions and experiences to users.

It’s the only GambleFi coin that distributes a share of profits to its users on a daily basis through its novel staking system.
The crypto market is witnessing significant movements. Toncoin’s new partnership with Curve Finance has catalyzed a surge in stablecoin trading, leading to a notable price rally. Concurrently, Bitcoin’s market dynamics have been influenced by the anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates, causing some investors to reassess their positions.

In this vibrant market environment, BlockDAG has launched an appealing offer. Following the successful deployment of its Testnet and the presale nearing the $76 million threshold, BlockDAG is extending a special offer to holders.


By employing the promotional code BDAG50 at checkout, participants are offered a chance to augment their BDAG holdings by 50% for a limited time. This promotion, which lasts until October 14th, coincides with the upcoming launch of BlockDAG’s new website and platform, marking a significant milestone that highlights the project’s escalating momentum and promising trajectory.

Toncoin’s Strategic Alliance with Curve Finance Elevates Market Position
Toncoin’s announcement of a partnership with Curve Finance to implement stable swap technology on the TON blockchain aims to enhance stablecoin trading by minimizing price volatility and slippage through Curve’s Constant Function Market Maker technology. This integration is designed to refine the trading experience and boost market liquidity.



Following this announcement, Toncoin’s value increased by 2.31% to $5.52, with trading volume up nearly 9%. Analysts are optimistic, projecting that the coin could potentially reach $10 by year’s end, although some caution remains dependent on user adoption and the operational efficacy of the new technology.

Analyzing Bitcoin’s Market Sentiment Post-Fed Announcement
Bitcoin is holding steady at around $60,000, facing a pivotal moment with the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision. Market observers are closely monitoring statements from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, as any changes could significantly influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. Typically, lower interest rates boost risk assets like Bitcoin, with the market hopeful for a favorable decision.


Despite market apprehensions, Bitcoin experienced a modest increase of 2.5% in European trading hours, supported by continued institutional interest. Recent inflows into Bitcoin-related investment products, totaling $187 million, indicate robust institutional confidence, though the market awaits clearer signals from the Fed.

BlockDAG’s Testnet Launch: A Prelude to Exceptional Growth
BlockDAG’s Testnet launch has sparked considerable interest among blockchain developers, eager to explore the platform’s features. This phase allows for the minting and transfer of BDAG coins via MetaMask, providing a practical insight into the platform’s security protocols and decentralized architecture.


This stage is critical for assessing BlockDAG’s scalability and transaction efficiency in a simulated setting. Developers’ active involvement in testing these capabilities further bolsters the growing interest in the project. For those holding over 7,500 BDAG coins, migration from Devnet to Testnet is now enabled, enhancing the project’s technical solidity and market credibility.

Amid this heightened activity, BlockDAG has also introduced a special promotion. Crypto enthusiasts have the opportunity to boost their BDAG holdings by 50% for a limited period. By using the BDAG50 code at checkout, participants can engage in this promotion and get 50% extra BDAG coins, celebrating both the successful Testnet launch and the presale’s approach to $76 million. This offer is available until October 14th, aligning with the anticipated unveiling of BlockDAG’s new website and platform, marking another significant milestone for the project.



To date, the presale has been notably successful. BlockDAG has raised over $76 million by selling more than 13.1 billion BDAG coins, demonstrating strong market confidence. With the presale advancing to its 23rd batch, the price of BDAG coins has climbed from $0.001 to $0.0192, achieving an 1820% increase. As developers and buyers continue to engage with the testnet, market experts predict BDAG could reach $20 by 2027, potentially offering a 20,000x ROI to early backers.

Final Reflections
Toncoin’s major partnership headlines recent crypto developments, while Bitcoin navigates market uncertainties following the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions. Meanwhile, BlockDAG stands out among emerging cryptocurrencies with its successful presale and Testnet launch.



With the Testnet now active and attracting significant developer interest, BlockDAG is leveraging this momentum with a special BDAG50 offer. This limited-time promotion, celebrating the successful Testnet launch, presale success and also the upcoming rebrand, not only highlights BlockDAG’s robust technical foundation.

Google Cloud and Solana Labs Team Up to Simplify Web3 Gaming with GameShift
Google Cloud has joined forces with Solana Labs to launch GameShift, a new API designed to make it easier for developers to integrate Web3 features like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital assets into their traditional Web2 games.

Bridging the Gap Between Web2 and Web3
According to the Google Cloud’s post from Sept. 23, GameShift is now available on the Google Cloud Marketplace and offers a comprehensive suite of tools tailored to gaming needs.

These tools include wallets, tokenized assets, on-chain markets, payment systems, and marketplaces. By leveraging GameShift, developers can seamlessly incorporate Web3 elements into their existing game backends, “without requiring any blockchain experience to get started.”


GameShift’s user-friendly interface and secure non-custodial wallets provide a smooth experience for players. Additionally, the platform helps game studios accelerate development and reduce costs by simplifying the Web3 integration process.


“Game studios have recently been considering Web3 for new approaches to growth and development, but are often discouraged by the seeming complexity of the technology and the Web3 community,” said Jack Buser, Director for Games at Google Cloud. He added:

“Game studios are already overburdened, and need solutions that provide simplified technical and cultural interfaces to Web3.”
Solana’s Ecosystem Expands
GameShift marks the next chapter in the ongoing collaboration between Google Cloud and Solana Labs. It follows their 2022 announcement, which saw Google Cloud become a node validator on Solana’s blockchain.

Solana’s influence extends beyond the realm of gaming. On Sept. 21, Travala, a crypto-based travel platform, announced its integration with Solana, enabling users to make travel bookings and earn rewards using SOL and stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).

At the 2024 Solana Breakpoint conference, Solana Labs also introduced its new smartphone, Solana Seeker. Designed for decentralized applications (DApps), the new smartphone features integrated crypto tools like the SeedVault wallet and DApp Seeker Store. Each Solana Seeker generates a unique Seeker Genesis Token and a “soulbound NFT” that unlocks exclusive rewards, offers, and content within the Solana ecosystem.


Solana Sees Record Surge in Active and New Addresses
The decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape on Solana is experiencing rapid expansion, with Solana’s total value locked (TVL) surpassing $5 billion, fueled by a significant increase in activity across DApps built on the platform.

The number of active addresses on Solana skyrocketed in September, reaching 60.5 million as of Sept. 24, a significant increase of 160% compared to August’s 23.3 million.

The number of new addresses on the Solana blockchain also surged in September, reaching 76.9 million by Sept. 24. This represents a substantial increase of 92% compared to August’s 39.9 million.

Solana’s native token, SOL, is experiencing growth, gaining +4% during the last 24 hours and 17% during the last seven days.
Worldcoin expanded its World ID verification services to Guatemala, Malaysia, and Poland on Wednesday, responding to growing concerns about AI-driven fraud and the need for secure online identity verification.

The company seeks to strengthen its global presence with these new services, offering secure methods to verify human users amid increasing digital threats.

Worldcoin Expands World ID to Guatemala, Malaysia, and Poland
According to an announcement by Worldcoin, the recent expansions are part of an effort to address the growing demand for secure identity verification, highlighted by surveys conducted in countries like Korea and Portugal.


These surveys reflect a heightened need for systems capable of distinguishing between human users and bots, as digital fraud rises alongside advancements in AI technology.

In Guatemala, the new verification service is available in Guatemala City, where residents aged 18 and over can verify their identities through World ID.


Residents can book appointments via the World App to access the service. Similarly, Malaysia and Poland are now part of this expansion, providing users with a robust tool for secure online interactions.

The Introduction of Face Auth to Enhance Security
As part of its continued efforts to strengthen the World ID system, Worldcoin recently introduced the Face Auth feature.


This feature adds an additional layer of security by offering private, on-device face comparison, ensuring that only verified users can access their World App wallet.

The Face Auth verification process involves three steps: users take a selfie, which is then compared to an image captured during the initial verification by the orb.

Once the system matches these images, the verification is complete, offering enhanced protection against fraudulent access.

Currently, this new feature is in a pilot phase, being tested in select locations. Worldcoin is evaluating its effectiveness before deciding on a broader rollout.

Alongside these developments, the company also released a privacy whitepaper detailing its approach to data protection, with a focus on transparency and consent.

Addressing Rising Security Concerns
Worldcoin’s expansion comes at a critical time, as the digital world faces increasingly complex threats from fraudulent activities.

The company’s growing global presence and the introduction of features like Face Auth are designed to meet the demand for secure online identity verification.

These efforts help address the pressing challenges posed by AI-driven fraud, ensuring a safer digital experience for users across the globe.
Dogwifhat (WIF) has surged over 20% this week, catching the attention of investors seeking high-potential opportunities.

However, with WIF facing long-term resistance, many are now turning to Crypto All-stars (STARS), a less-than-1-cent ICO, as a promising alternative.

Currently trading just above $2.00, WIF is approaching a key resistance level that may trigger sell-offs as investors grow cautious.


Source: TradingView / WIFUSD
Some investors are speculating that the return of meme coin interest, driven by central banks cutting interest rates, might push WIF beyond its resistance level and back toward its yearly highs.


However, cautious investors are likely to take profits as WIF approaches resistance, with many seeking new opportunities like meme coin presales.

Why Dogwifhat Investors Are Turning to Crypto All-stars
Presales allow investors to participate in emerging projects before they reach broader markets, making them an attractive option.


One such project is Crypto All-stars (STARS), a meme coin staking protocol designed to provide yield opportunities for holders of major meme coins.

Offering a passive income mechanism, Crypto All-stars has gained considerable traction in meme coin trading communities.

Crypto All-stars allows meme coin holders to lock their assets in its MemeVault in exchange for a high STARS yield.

The more STARS tokens users own, the higher the yield they receive, incentivizing early participation. This system has attracted attention due to its potential for substantial returns.

The Rising Appeal of Crypto All-stars
Crypto All-stars is gaining attention from meme coin enthusiasts, with strong engagement on social media.

The project has over 16,000 followers on X and more than 2,000 members in its Telegram community.

Several crypto influencers, including ClayBro, Crypto Boy, and Jacob Crypto Bury, have discussed the project in their analyses.


Unsurprisingly, early investors have already committed over $1.6 million to Crypto All-stars. STARS is currently priced at $0.001465, but this price is expected to rise once the presale hits $1.84 million.

Early participants are currently enjoying yields of 926% on their tokens, making Crypto All-stars a noteworthy opportunity for meme coin investors.

With the potential to leave its mark on the meme coin sector in 2024, Crypto All-stars has the attention of investors seeking the next big opportunity
One lucky meme coin trader turned a $400 investment in the two-week-old baby hippo-themed Solana meme coin Moo Deng ($MOODENG) into over $420,000.

Moo Deng is based on the eponymous adorable baby hippo internet sensation in Thailand’s Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Chonburi.

Her name means “bouncy pork” in the local lingo and the pygmy went viral after various online videos surfaced showing her cute hyperactive demeanour and always moist appearance.


According to meme coin wallet tracker Kakashi (X handle: @KKashi_YT), the anonymous investor made an initial purchase of $401 worth of $MOODENG, which blew up to close to half a million dollars.

They then sold what was worth $60,000 at the time and kept $363,000.


According to SolScan, the anonymous trader’s wallet now holds a $MOODENG stash worth $726,770.

$MOODENG’s first two weeks of trading show frantic bullish activity with frequent cup-and-handle patterns being formed by the candles, alongside near-vertical ascents.

There isn’t enough data to be able to accurately predict whether the rally will end soon or continue indefinitely.


A falling relative strength index (RSI) of 50 suggests $MOODENG’s price may briefly hold at its current level, but whether it continues to go up is contingent on the token’s overall popularity.

It’s currently up 30% in the last 24 hours with a market cap approaching $86 million.

$MOODENG and Memebet Casino Signal the Start of Meme Season
Moodeng is an exemplary reminder of the kind of market fervor that propels meme coins into the limelight.

However, once they’re there, eyebrows remain raised as to what people can actually use them for.

However, one ascendant new project called Memebet hopes to change that.

It has quietly raised well over a quarter of a million dollars in under a fortnight thanks to its first-of-its-kind premise: it’s the web’s first online casino where players use meme coins.

The presale launched last week and the $MEMEBET token received over $200,000 in investments in just two days.

With online gambling primed to explode from a $100 billion industry in 2024 to $130 billion within the next five years alongside the growing adoption of crypto, $MEMEBET is positioned to take advantage of both emerging technologies, unlike Sui Network.


$MEMEBET tokens unlock a range of benefits for players, including airdrop rewards, special VIP degen bonuses, and access to the upcoming Memebet Casino Lootboxes, featuring real-world prizes and casino bonuses.

The project also launched a 400 million $MEMEBET airdrop.

To join, simply buy some tokens, wait for the launch of the casino (before the end of the presale), and begin gaming and betting to secure rewards.
Anthony Pompliano believes Bitcoin could benefit greatly as interest rates decline and global liquidity increases.

In a recent TV interview with CNBC, Professional Capital Management founder and CEO Anthony Pompliano highlighted that Bitcoin’s price movements are closely tied to shifts in global liquidity, as it outperformed other assets post-rate cut.

Is BTC the Best Asset Post Rate Cut?
He noted that with central banks, including the Federal Reserve, signaling a shift towards monetary easing, Bitcoin could see substantial gains as more capital flows into the market in the coming months.

Pompliano mentioned a new study that discovered Bitcoin as the most sensitive asset regarding global liquidity.

“And so 83 percent of the time, Bitcoin moves with global liquidity. It’s more than S&P or any other asset,” he said.


He elaborated that Bitcoin’s performance is not only influenced by interest rate changes but also by broader monetary policies globally. Recent liquidity injections from various central banks, including those in China, could have created a favorable environment for the digital asset.


“Bitcoin ends up being a big winner whenever we get kind of cheap money flooding into the system,” stated Pompliano.

He also touched on the role of institutional investments, noting that the recent inflow of capital through various channels, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has contributed to Bitcoin’s price movement.

However, Pompliana acknowledged that it would be challenging to quantify how much of the recent surge is driven by long-term holders versus short-term traders.

How is Bitcoin Different from Ethereum & Solana
Pompliano mentioned that he sold all his Ethereum holdings last year and shifted to Solana, citing the latter’s efficiency and lower transaction costs as key advantages. He believes Solana’s network could perform better financially in certain use cases.

“Ethereum for me… I sold all the Ethereum and I bought Solana instead,” he said. “I thought that asset and that network is just cheaper, it’s faster. It’s going to probably do better financially.”

He also differentiated between monetary assets like Bitcoin and stablecoins and technological platforms like Ethereum and Solana, highlighting that each serves distinct roles in the crypto ecosystem.

kamala harris, stand with crypto, presidential election
Stand With Crypto has altered the crypto-friendly rating given by the Coinbase-backed crypto collective of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

According to a September 23 X post from Stand With Crypto’s official account, Harris had received a B rating overall for her stance on digital assets due to a recent statement where she promised to “invest in America’s competitiveness” by encouraging “innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors.”

Stand With Crypto Alters Kamala Harris Scorecard
The move drew controversy from members of the crypto community, given that the newly appointed Democratic candidate has yet to unveil her policy on digital assets officially.

Stand With Crypto then announced in an additional X post late Thursday that it had adjusted its scoring guidelines and reverted Harris’ crypto score to N/A to reflect this change.

“We were built for the crypto community and we hear you,” Stand With Crypto said. “SWC has updated our scorecard & now requires additional clarity from candidates up & down the ballot in order to qualify for a letter grade.”


“We’ve gotten a ton of feedback at @StandWithCrypto on our politician scorecard recently, and I wanted you to know we’ve listened and made changes,” Stand With Crypto’s Executive Director, Logan Dobson, posted to X Thursday. “Specifically, it will now be more difficult for candidates to receive a scorecard grade – any grade, positive or negative.”

Trump, Crypto And The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election
While Harris has shied away from discussing the blockchain sector on the campaign trail, Republican nominee Donald Trump has largely embraced the industry.


At the Bitcoin Conference 2024 this past July, the former reality television star promised to enact crypto-friendly regulation if elected U.S. president for the second time.

“We will have regulations, but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry,” Trump told audiences.

Most recently, Trump formally launched his family’s nascent crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, where he targeted the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulation-by-enforcement approach to digital assets.

“If for some reason bad, bad things happen and we don’t win the election, those people that were under investigation and that are free as a bird right now, people that were being looked at in the crypto world, they will be living in hell because it will start the day after the election if they win,” he said.

SC Ventures' Fintechs Team Up to Streamline Global Trade Finance
SWIAT, a Frankfurt-based blockchain software developer, recently announced a partnership with Olea, the digital financial market infrastructure in Singapore.

In preparation for financing, Olea tokenized receivables arising from a supplier’s delivery of goods. With its blockchain infrastructure designed to meet stringent regulatory requirements like the incoming Basel III, SWIAT provided the technological backbone for this approach. Olea’s platform then matched the tokenized receivables with a suitable funder.

DekaBank, a joint-venture partner in SWIAT, was the inaugural funder for the tokenized receivable. The project leveraged SWIAT’s tokenization engine and Olea’s expertise in trade receivables financing.

Trillions in Trade Finance: Untapped Potential for Blockchain
The global trade finance market was valued at $9.3 trillion in 2022 and is expected to reach $12.5 trillion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 3%, according to the Trade Finance Market report.


Supply chain finance solutions offer companies a way to optimize working capital by extending payment terms to suppliers while ensuring timely payments. Trade finance is considered a particularly safe form of finance due to its predictable collateral and documented operational flows.


By leveraging blockchain, SWIAT and Olea seek to address the challenges of traditional trade finance, such as slow processing times, complex documentation, high costs, and risk of fraud and errors, and create a more efficient and transparent ecosystem for businesses worldwide.

Both companies are backed by SC Ventures, Standard Chartered’s innovation arm, and this collaboration will also allow them to expand their reach in Singapore and Germany.

Blockchain-Powered Digital Securities
SWIAT predicts that digital assets will become increasingly important globally as asset tokenization expands. The company estimates that the European decentralized financial market will experience significant growth, exceeding 60% per year to reach over €3 trillion ($3.34 trillion) by 2030.

SWIAT’s private blockchain has been responsible for numerous digital bond issuances in recent months.

On Sept. 13, Siemens successfully issued €100,000 worth of crypto securities (around $111.3k) under Germany’s Electronic Securities Act (eWpG). Just three days later, the securities were redeemed.

Payments were processed on the Onyx network using JP Morgan’s JPM Coin, while asset transfers were settled on SWIAT’s delivery-versus-payment (DvP) mechanism. The entire transaction, from the parties’ confirmation of the trade on SWIAT to the final confirmation of settlement, was completed in just 93 seconds.

DekaBank, acting as a regulated crypto securities registrar on the SWIAT network, also participated in the process.

Earlier this month, Siemens also issued a €300 million digital bond ($334 million) on the SWIAT blockchain, which was settled with conventional central bank money using Germany’s Trigger solution, which automates central bank payments through the TARGET 2 system.

The issuance was part of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) trials on wholesale distributed ledger technology (DLT) settlement.

Solana Price Forecast: Analyst Sees Altcoin Season Coming
Source: FellowNeko/ Adobe Stock
The Solana (SOL) price could be set to surge in the months ahead as calls grow for the return of a new altcoin season that could see major altcoins like Solana drastically outperform Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

Solana was last trading just under $150. It had rallied hard from its $120 September lows in tandem with a broader crypto market rally.

The catalyst for the recent market recovery has been the start of a new Fed-led global central bank easing cycle and a drop in concerns that the US economy is on the verge of tilting into recession.


Lower interest rates and better liquidity conditions worldwide are expected to power Bitcoin higher in the coming years.

But as liquidity flows into risk assets, altcoins could perform even better, hence the calls for a new altcoin season.


Widely followed analyst Ali Martinez thinks technicals could help.

In a post on X, he writes that looking at a TradingView chart, TOTAL (the market cap of cryptos excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum) could soon surge above $1 trillion.


Solana would be a prime beneficiary of a new altcoin season.

The Solana price currently remains stuck towards the lower part of its recent $120-200 range.

But a bullish breakout above $200 could soon come as the new altcoin season arrives.

Solana Price Forecast: Analyst Sees Altcoin Season Coming
But could the Solana price mirror its amazing 2021 surge?

Could the Solana Price Mirror Its 2021 Surge?
Solana was one of the stunning success stories of 2021. After hitting $1 in December 2020, Solana rallied 260x to $260 in November 2021.

Assuming Solana’s drop to $8 in late 2022 was its most recent bottom, a 260x surge would see the Solana price reach above $2,000.

For $2,000, Solana would have a fully diluted market capitalization of $1.17 trillion.

While not probable in the short term, it isn’t unrealistic that Solana could reach a market cap this high in the long run.

That’s assuming global crypto adoption continues in the years ahead (highly probable), and Solana remains a leading blockchain (again, highly probable).

However, the current bull market might see the Solana price post 3-4x gains from its current levels.

Those are very good gains that almost any investor would be happy with.

That said, crypto degens are a different breed, with many hunting for the next 100x coin to take them from rags to riches.

They should check out an exciting new meme coin called Crypto All-Stars.

Illegal crypto miners in the Russian republic of Dagestan have started building “farms” underground to avoid detection as they steal power from grids.

Per TASS and a Telegram post from the Dagestan’s Cabinet of Ministers, police officers and energy officials raided a subterranean crypto mining hideaway in Makhachkala, the republic’s capital.

The cabinet released a video of the raid. This appears to show banks of crypto mining rigs operating in a tiny space several meters under the ground.

Police said they discovered “17 cryptocurrency mining devices” underground in the city’s Sergokalinsky District.

Officers also said that the farm was run by “energy thieves.” The cabinet claimed that miners have “begun to create underground farms” and “mobile mining units” in several parts of Dagestan.

The cabinet added that “illegal cryptocurrency miners” were responsible for “a fire at the 110 kV Novaya substation.”


This incident, which occurred earlier this month, left “part of the capital without power for several days,” the cabinet noted.

Police have been working with Dagenergo, the North Caucasus branch of the Russian state-owned power provider Rosseti.

The republic’s government has been discussing a response at a meeting on energy and communal services.

“The Deputy Prime Minister noted that more attention should be paid to the issues of combating illegal mining in the republic. Illegal cryptocurrency miners are coming up with new methods of ‘circumventing’ the law. They are doing this by installing their farms underground.”


Dagestan Cabinet of Ministers
Government to Spend $32.5 Million on Repairs
The cabinet hinted that Dagenergo and the police have shut down other, undisclosed, illegal crypto mining “farms” in the republic of late.

The Dagestan government has announced it will spend “about 3 billion rubles ($32.5 million)” on “repair work at energy facilities in the republic.”


Dagenergo confirmed that the substation fire was caused by a sharp “increase in electricity consumption.”

Earlier this year, Dagenergo implored miners to “kindly” “turn off” their rigs. The power provider begged illegal miners to “think about their loved ones and neighbors.”
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has commended the recent development of Celo Network, a mobile-first blockchain platform.

He praised the network’s recent growth, surpassing Tron in daily active addresses due to stablecoin usage. Buterin said that the growth of the network is “amazing to see.”

“Improving worldwide access to basic payments/finance has always been a key way that Ethereum can be good for the world, and it’s great to see Celo getting traction.”


According to data from Artemis, Celo, the Ethereum Layer-2 network, carried more stablecoin transaction in a short time frame.

Celo increased its daily active users this year, seeing close to 700K daily active addresses, per Tokenterminal.


Artemis wrote that “transfer sizes across all buckets are growing, indicating that it is not addresses spamming the network making very small transactions.”


Last month, Buterin unveiled plans for cross-chain interoperability between Ethereum Layer-2 networks. Buterin discussed the most promising approaches to resolving cross-L2 interoperability challenges.

Besides Celo, Buterin has previously endorsed Optimism for supporting Ethereum’s ecosystem development. His support came after Optimism adopted the ERC-7683 standardisation protocol.


Celo to Transition Into an L2
Furthermore, Celo announced that it is evolving into an Ethereum Layer-2 from a standalone EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain.

The network announced that the shift will maintain a seamless user experience, including low costs and ease of use. The network is currently operating two Layer 2 tenets: Dango, which is already live, and Alfajores, which is due to be upgraded on September 26.

In 2020, Celo raised over $100M from a16z and Coinbase Ventures.

Following Buterin’s mention, the network’s native token, CELO, saw a small rally on Binance. The token’s price surged from $0.55 to $0.69. According to Coinmarketcap, it is currently trading at $0.66.
Global payments behemoth PayPal has announced that it will allow US business account customers to buy, hold and sell cryptos directly from their accounts.

The move comes as business clients increasingly seek to use the crypto services available to customers. Further, PayPal intends to increase its crypto reach into mainstream business operations. The functionality for business accounts will not be available in New York State, the announcement read.

PayPal and its peer-to-peer payments app Venmo, first allowed consumers to manage crypto in 2020. Thereafter, the company has “continuously made significant steps to increase cryptocurrency’s utilisation,” the announcement read.

“We have learned a lot about how they want to use their cryptocurrency,” said Jose Fernandez da Ponte, senior VP of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and digital currencies at PayPal.

“Business owners have increasingly expressed a desire for the same cryptocurrency capabilities available to consumers. We’re excited to meet that demand by delivering this new offering, empowering them to engage with digital currencies effortlessly.”

Businesses Can Transfer Crypto on-chain to Third Party Wallets
The company also noted that the new feature would allow business accounts to transfer crypto on-chain to third-party wallets.


“PayPal business account holders can now send and receive supported cryptocurrency tokens to and from external blockchain addresses,” it said.

Last month, Crypto.com collaborated with PayPal to enable US users to access crypto purchases. Along with Crypto.com, PayPal’s stablecoin is also available on a few other selected exchanges, including Bitstamp, Coinbase, and Kraken.

PayPal launched its native U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin (PYUSD) in 2023. Issued by Paxos Trust Company, a U.S.-regulated entity, PYUSD benefits from strong compliance and security standards, making it a trusted choice for digital transactions.

Initially, PYUSD was introduced as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. However, recently, it was made available on the Solana blockchain for increased flexibility and control. In fact, PayPal’s PYUSD has seen its supply on the Solana blockchain surpass that of Ethereum.
Bitcoin price remains supported, as in a speech on September 25, Kamala Harris emphasized the need for the U.S. to lead in blockchain and other advanced technologies like artificial intelligence. She stressed that staying ahead of global competitors, especially China, requires investing in innovation and ensuring consumer protection.

While Harris has only recently discussed digital assets, her stance is sparking debates on how her presidency could impact Bitcoin (BTC) and broader crypto markets.

In a speech on September 25, Kamala Harris emphasized the importance of the United States becoming a global leader in blockchain, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies. She highlighted the need to protect consumers and invest in innovation to stay ahead of competitors like China.

While Harris has only recently spoken about digital assets, experts are divided on how her presidency might impact Bitcoin (BTC). Some predict Bitcoin could fall to $30,000, while others believe her leadership could accelerate its adoption.

On the other hand, if Trump wins, his pro-crypto stance could push Bitcoin toward $90,000.


Experts also suggest that rising national debt and budget deficits could create a favorable environment for Bitcoin, regardless of the election outcome.

Saudi Arabia Leads MENA in Cryptocurrency Growth for Second Year
For the second consecutive year, Saudi Arabia is leading cryptocurrency growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), with a 154% market expansion, according to Chainalysis. This surge is largely driven by decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and a young population—63% of Saudis are under 30—who are more open to adopting new financial technologies.


Qatar is quickly catching up, planning to introduce new digital asset legislation in 2024. The MENA region’s crypto market is dominated by large transactions, primarily handled by institutional and professional investors.

As cryptocurrency adoption increases in regions like Saudi Arabia, institutional investment and demand for Bitcoin (BTC) are expected to rise, potentially boosting BTC prices. The growing interest in decentralized systems further underscores this trend.

PayPal Expands Crypto Services to U.S. Businesses; Impact on Bitcoin Price
PayPal is expanding its cryptocurrency services to U.S. corporate accounts, allowing businesses to buy, store, and sell digital currencies directly. This move responds to business owners’ demand for the same features available to retail users.

However, the service is currently unavailable in New York due to regulatory restrictions. U.S. merchants will also be able to transfer cryptocurrencies to third-party wallets.


Since launching crypto services for consumers in 2020, PayPal has introduced PayPal USD (PYUSD), a popular stablecoin. By extending these services to business accounts, PayPal is helping to further legitimize cryptocurrencies within the banking system.


This expanded access could increase demand for Bitcoin, potentially driving up prices as more businesses adopt digital currencies.

Bitcoin Price Daily Outlook: September 26, 2024
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) trades near $63,470, reflecting a slight dip of 0.02%. On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin is finding support from a rising trendline near the $63,000 level, increasing the chances of a bullish continuation.

Around this same area, BTC has also formed a double-bottom pattern, which traditionally signals a potential bullish reversal.


If the momentum holds, BTC could aim for the immediate resistance zone at $63,800, with further upside targets around $64,400 and $64,800.

WazirX
A Singapore court has granted a four-month conditional moratorium to the troubled Indian crypto exchange WazirX following a $234 million hack in July.

The court’s decision comes with several stipulations, including the requirement for WazirX to disclose the addresses of its wallets through a court affidavit and to respond promptly to user inquiries.

Additionally, the exchange must provide its financial records within six weeks and ensure that any future voting regarding its operations is conducted on an independent platform.

In an emailed statement to Cryptonews.com, Nischal Shetty, Founder of WazirX said:

“We are thankful for the court’s decision, which allows us to focus on our path to resolution, recovery and restructuring. WazirX will continue to provide updates on our progress and further developments. We are steadfast in our commitment to resolve this matter efficiently and equitably.”

WazirX initially sought a six-month moratorium in light of the breach, which resulted in the loss of approximately 45% of its customers’ funds. WazirX further noted:

“As part of the court’s conditions, WazirX will make wallet addresses public via a court affidavit, respond to user queries raised in the courtroom, release financial information, and ensure future voting for court applications is scrutinized by independent parties.”


Legal representatives for WazirX have indicated that customers may not recover their losses in cryptocurrency. During the court proceedings, the presiding judge encouraged the exchange’s legal team to consider disclosing any assets it holds beyond its current token holdings, noting that WazirX’s initiative to seek a moratorium demonstrated good faith.

WazirX Hacker Launders Most of the Funds Through Tornado Cash
A wallet associated with the funds stolen from WazirX now contains only $6 million in ether (ETH). According to blockchain data from Arkham, the stolen assets are frequently transferred to new wallets before being funneled into the privacy service Tornado Cash.

In August, the hacker funneled over $50 million in tokens to Tornado, with increased activity noted in September. The most recent transaction involved a transfer of 3,792 ETH, valued at approximately $10 million, to a new wallet earlier on Wednesday.
US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their fifth consecutive day of inflows, amassing a total of $106 million on Wednesday.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the surge, attracting $184 million in net investments, according to Farside Investors data.

Meanwhile, Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF (BITB) gained an additional $2 million. However, not all funds shared this momentum.

Fidelity’s FBTC Reports Outflows
Fidelity’s Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the ARK Invest/21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) reported significant outflows of approximately $33 million and $47 million, respectively.

Other major Bitcoin ETFs, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), saw no inflows.

Since its conversion to an ETF, GBTC has experienced over $20 billion in investor withdrawals.


While the initial outflows were substantial, they have tapered off in recent weeks.

As capital shifts towards other funds, particularly BlackRock’s IBIT, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively accumulated around $246 million in net inflows this week, showcasing sustained investor interest in the crypto asset class.


Meanwhile, US-listed Ethereum spot ETFs also witnessed a strong performance on Thursday, registering a net inflow of $43.23 million.

The boost comes despite a cumulative outflow of $580.94 million over the past week, reflecting a growing investor interest in Ethereum-based exchange-traded products.

According to data from SoSoValue, Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF (ETHE) led the pack with a minor daily inflow, although the fund has seen a total outflow of $2.85 billion to date.

BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA) followed, drawing in $9.38 million on Monday. Fidelity’s FETH also performed well, accumulating $6.45 million in new investments.

On the other hand, VanEck’s ETHV and Franklin’s EZET ETFs experienced no net inflows.

As the total value traded across Ethereum ETFs reached $124.18 million, the total net assets now stand at $7.03 billion, representing 2.26% of Ethereum’s market cap.

SEC Postpones Decision on ETH ETF Options
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on Nasdaq’s proposed rule change to list and trade options on BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA).

Originally expected by September 26, the SEC’s decision has now been pushed back to November 10.

As reported, the agency said the delay allows it to assess the potential implications of such a move on market stability.

The SEC’s decision to delay is not unusual.

Under Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act, the regulator has the authority to extend its review period for up to 90 days to thoroughly evaluate the potential risks and benefits of the proposal.

The decision comes shortly after the SEC approved options trading for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), following amendments to address concerns about market manipulation and excessive risk-taking.

In addition to postponing the ruling on BlackRock’s Ethereum options, the SEC has also delayed its decision on a separate proposal by NYSE American LLC.
Four victims or family members of victims of state-sponsored terrorism have filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), accusing it of improperly withholding or delaying the distribution of funds from Binance’s $4.3 billion settlement.

The lawsuit, filed on September 25 in a Washington, D.C. federal court, claims that the DOJ failed to deposit the proceeds into the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, as mandated by law.

According to the plaintiffs, the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act stipulates that 100% of criminal proceeds and 75% of civil proceeds from relevant cases should be allocated to the fund, which was created to compensate victims of state-sponsored terrorism.

However, the DOJ has allegedly deposited only $898.6 million into the fund so far.

DOJ to Deposit $1.5B into Fund for Crime Victims
The DOJ has stated its intention to direct at least $1.5 billion into a fund for crime victims, which the lawsuit argues is in violation of the law.

The plaintiffs are seeking a court order requiring the DOJ to deposit all qualifying proceeds from Binance’s settlement into the Victims Fund.


The lawsuit also names the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, the Treasury Department, and its agencies, including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), as defendants.

Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, pled guilty in November 2023 to violating U.S. sanctions and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).

The company agreed to pay over $4.3 billion in fines and forfeitures.

Former CEO Changpeng Zhao also pled guilty to one felony charge related to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, paid a $50 million penalty, and stepped down as CEO.

He was sentenced to four months in jail and is scheduled for release on September 29.

The DOJ’s national security and crime divisions launched an investigation into Binance in May 2023 for allegedly providing services to Russians after sanctions were imposed on the country in April 2022.

Binance Aids India Bust $47.6M Fiewin Gaming Scam
On Wednesday, Binance revealed that it had played a pivotal role in assisting India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED) in dismantling a $47.6 million gaming scam linked to the Fiewin app.

The scam involved luring victims into online betting and gaming, promising easy earnings before seizing their funds.

According to a press release shared with Cryptonews.com, Binance’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) provided crucial information that helped trace the funds and expose the fraud network.

On the same day, the exchange also introduced a new pre-market spot trading service, setting itself apart as the first crypto exchange to offer trading of actual tokens prior to their official spot market listing.

Binance said the new service would allow its users to gain early exposure to new tokens, enhancing their trading strategies.

However, the service is not available in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is set to make waves in the financial markets with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving the listing and trading of options on its Bitcoin spot ETF.

This approval is expected to increase liquidity, attract long-term investors, and boost participation in the Bitcoin market, according to the research firm CryptoQuant.

The introduction of options for the IBIT Bitcoin spot ETF will provide investors with a tool to hedge or speculate on Bitcoin price moves. It’s another step toward broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin, a trend that has been gaining momentum in recent years.

The ability to trade options means BlackRock’s IBIT ETF will allow investors to manage their risk profiles more effectively, increasing their confidence in entering the cryptocurrency market, highlights CryptoQuant.

Options Mean Rise in Bitcoin Shorting
“Options could also mean that the ‘paper’ supply of Bitcoin will increase, as investors can get exposure to Bitcoin (buying or selling) without having to invest through the spot market being long without actually buying Bitcoin or being short/selling without having to buy Bitcoin in the first place,” according to CryptoQuant.

The chart below CryptoQuant highlights the Bitcoin supply in the perpetual futures market of crypto exchanges, as measured by the open interest in terms of Bitcoin. This increased during the bear market of 2022 from 279K to 549K Bitcoin as investors shorted Bitcoin.


Historically, Bitcoin has been seen as a high-volatility asset, but options offer a way to mitigate some of that risk by allowing investors to hedge positions or take speculative bets with limited downside.


This surge in liquidity echoes the trend seen in the Bitcoin options market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where open interest reached a record high of nearly $500 million on March 12, 2024. This is a five-fold increase from 2023 levels, illustrating the growing demand for derivatives tied to Bitcoin.

Overall, the approval of IBIT options trading is being seen as an evolution in the Bitcoin market, opening new doors for both institutional and retail investors.

With the approval of spot ETFs and now options it seems the U.S. market is once again gaining dominance in Bitcoin holdings, according to CryptoQuant analyst Ki Young Ju.


SEC Postpones Decision on Ethereum ETF Options
The SEC has postponed its decision on Nasdaq’s proposed rule change to list and trade options on BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). Originally expected by September 26, the SEC’s decision has now been pushed back to November 10.

(The article has been edited with inputs from Truflation CEO Stefan Rust)

Truflation, a Coinbase Ventures-backed blockchain project, confirmed on Wednesday that it suffered a malware attack but did not disclose the value of compromised funds.

“On September 25th, 2024, the Truflation team detected some abnormal activity,” the platform wrote on X. “We are currently monitoring the situation and are taking measures to protect funds while we are investigating and working with law enforcement.”


The team noted that it is working round-the-clock with leading industry partners and trying to contact the attacker to retrieve lost assets.


Per Web3 security firm Cyvers, the attackers took control of Truflation’s safe address, leading to a loss of $4.6 million worth of TRUF tokens.


Blockchain investigator ZachXBT also flagged the threat on Telegram, mentioning that the project lost around $5 million in a hack. According to the blockchain sleuth, the funds were drained from “treasury multisig and personal wallets.”

Following the hack, Truflation halted its staking services to ensure the safety of assets. It also opened a reward to any white hats offering assistance in the investigation or recovery efforts.

No Customer Funds Compromised: Truflation
The platform confirmed to a user in an X chat that “no customer funds compromised.”

Further, the blockchain project also updated on the ongoing active investigations. “We are closely monitoring all systems to prevent further breaches,” Truflation said.

The project posted a video of CEO Stefan Rust who said that the malware was injected into the computers, most likely in Singapore during Token2049, held last week. “That resulted in getting access to treasury funds,” he added.


“There are no customer funds at risk,” he confirmed. “We are as transparent as we can and keeping you abreast of the situation.”

“We are working with the best investigators and crypto security experts to ensure that we can track this down.”

According to Zapper, attackers drained $3.89M in TRUF, $1.07M in ETH, and $236.7K in DAI from the team’s Ethereum wallets. They also stole other tokens including BNB, WETH and qSQTH.


Screenshot from the video. Source: X
CEO Stefan Rust also noted that his personal account was hacked. Additionally, he warned about scammers who impersonate as Truflation team to ask user’s TRUF tokens.

“We will not ask you for tokens. There are already additional scammers coming out there and asking you to deposit a stake and return your TRUF tokens and they will burn it. Don’t listen to those sites.”

This comes at a time when Truflation is coming up with a bunch of exciting announcements. “I am super excited and disappointed,” Rust added.

“While this incident is regrettable, it does not impact Truflation’s ongoing development or our ability to roll out forthcoming features, including new indices, the mainnet launch, and the Truflation Stream Network,” the CEO told Cryptonews.

Furthermore, the platform has announced a bounty of $500,000 for the return of the stolen funds. Truflation will offer the bounty, if the attackers return the remaining 90% of funds.

“If the hackers return the funds, we will drop charges and there will be no risk of law enforcement issues.”

However, if the attacker chooses not to partake in the voluntary return of funds by September 28, Truflation would extend the bounty to the public. It would offer the full 10% to the person that identifies the attackers, in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.

Rexas Finance is making waves in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector as it allows crypto users to digitally tokenize any RWA whether it’s real estate, art, commodities, or intellectual property.


Multiple Revenue Streams for Crypto Investors

SBI Digital Markets (SBIDM), a subsidiary of Japan’s largest online financial services group, SBI Holdings, said it is working with German firm 21X, a distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based market infrastructure provider on listing tokenized securities.

SBIDM will list tokenized securities on 21 X’s DLT market, which has a trading and settlement system on a public permissionless blockchain.

21X said it is in the process of applying for a license to operate a DLT trading and settlement system (DLT TSS) under the European Union’s DLT regime (DLTR).

Once approved, 21X is expected to become a fully regulated DLT market operator in Europe, overseen by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).

SBIDM to Handle Custody of Tokenized Securities
SBIDM said it will serve as a listing agent and service provider for asset tokenization and handle the custody of tokenized securities on 21X.

The focus will be on issuing and trading exchange-traded notes (ETNs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on 21X’s DLT platform.


SBIDM has a strong presence in the Asia-Pacific region, with investors from Singapore, Japan, and Thailand the firm said it will gain access to European markets through this new venture.

“Our strategic partnership with SBIDM marks a significant point in the development of 21X and the globalization of blockchain-leveraging capital markets,” said Max Heinzle, founder and CEO of 21X.

He added that SBIDM, with its strong presence in Asia, will use 21X as a gateway to Europe, taking advantage of the first fully regulated DLT exchange for tokenized securities.

Tokenization Trend
The growing trend of tokenizing traditional assets has caught the attention of legacy financial institutions.

According to a recent report by Moody’s, a leading investment risk assessment firm, the value of tokenized funds has surged from $100 million at the beginning of 2023 to approximately $800 million today, driven by the rising tokenization of U.S. treasuries.

Crypto-Friendly NYC Mayor Eric Adams Indicted in Foreign Donations Corruption Probe
New York City Mayor Eric Adams, known for his pro-crypto stance, has been indicted in a federal corruption investigation. The charges, still sealed, stem from a probe into his 2021 mayoral campaign and alleged illegal foreign donations, particularly from the Turkish government.

The indictment made Adams the first sitting mayor in the city’s history to face federal charges just months before his re-election campaign for 2025.

NYC Mayor Eric Adams Indicted: The Future Of Crypto At Stake?
According to the New York Times, this investigation was initiated by the FBI and federal prosecutors in Manhattan and revolves around allegations that Adams and his campaign conspired with the Turkish government to receive illicit contributions.

Investigators are particularly focused on whether Adams accepted foreign donations and pressured New York Fire Department officials to approve a new Turkish consulate high-rise despite safety concerns.

Further scrutiny centers on whether Adams received perks such as flight upgrades from Turkish Airlines, partially owned by the Turkish government.

Upon learning of the indictment, Adams issued a defiant statement in a video, categorically denying any wrongdoing.


Adams framed the investigation as politically motivated, he said;

“If I am charged, I am innocent, and I will fight this with every ounce of my strength and spirit,”

Source: NYT
The probe began in 2021 and has involved key figures in Adams’ inner circle.

One of the most prominent moments in the investigation came last year when the FBI searched the home of Adams’ chief fundraiser, Brianna Suggs, seizing digital devices and documents linked to the mayor.

Suggs has not been formally accused of any crimes, but the search signaled the widening scope of the investigation.

Other officials, including Rana Abbasova, Adams’ former liaison to the Turkish community, and Cenk Öcal, a former Turkish Airlines executive, were also caught up in the probe.

While neither has been charged, Abbasova has since cooperated with authorities, further escalating the situation for Adams.

Political Fallout Amid Crypto’s Future Uncertainty
While Adams campaigned to reduce crime and embrace innovation, particularly in the crypto space, his administration was scandalous.

Investigations into his administration have led to the resignation of several high-ranking officials, including Police Commissioner Edward Caban and Schools Chancellor David Banks.

Both stepped down following FBI raids that seized their electronic devices.

Adams’ embrace of cryptocurrency has been one of the defining features of his time as mayor.

Shortly after taking office, he famously accepted his first three paychecks in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

His crypto advocacy was seen as a bold move to attract tech talent and investment to the city.

However, the ongoing federal investigation threatens to overshadow these efforts, potentially jeopardizing his political future and crypto-friendly policies.

The charges also come at a critical time for Adams, who is set to run for re-election in 2025. The federal investigation is expected to dominate public discourse, with calls for his resignation growing louder.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was one of the first to publicly state that Adams could no longer effectively lead the city, given the suspicion surrounding him.

His political challengers, including former Comptroller Scott Stringer, have seized the opportunity to criticize his leadership.

Stringer has described Adams’ administration as a;

“broken-down train wreck of a municipal government.”

Adding to the gravity of the situation is the possibility of Adams being removed from office.
Suggestions had it that New York Governor Kathy Hochul could oust him if his legal troubles impede his ability to govern effectively.

VARA Crypto
Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) said it has updated its marketing regulations as part of its broader framework for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) operating in the Emirates. The new regulations will come into effect on October 1.

The updated regulations will be stricter and aim to avoid “misleading information” and increase transparency, and consumer protection in the marketing practices of the rapidly growing virtual assets sector in Dubai.

The centrepiece of these updates is VARA’s new “Marketing Guidance Document” which provides instructions for VASPs engaged in promoting their services within the region. The online document is designed to help VASPs navigate the regulatory landscape while ensuring that their marketing efforts meet the highest standards of accuracy, ethical conduct, and transparency, said VARA.

Rules Apply to All Firms Marketing Virtual Assets in UAE
Updated regulations aim to prevent misleading information and prioritize the protection of consumer interests. The rules apply to all entities involved in marketing virtual assets or related activities in Dubai, regardless of their licensing status with VARA.

This means that both licensed and unlicensed entities are subject to the same marketing rules, ensuring consistent standards across the industry.

The regulations cover various aspects of marketing communications, including the proper use of language and the importance of providing full and clear disclosures.


The goal is to make sure that consumers are well-informed about the risks and opportunities associated with virtual assets. Ethical marketing is a core principle, ensuring that advertising in this space is not only legal but also transparent and fair to potential investors and users, said VARA.

Hefty Fines
Those breaking the new rules and violating marketing regulations could face huge fines of up to 10,000,000 AED ($2.7 million).


“As the world’s first independent regulator for virtual assets, VARA is dedicated to creating a regulatory environment that not only protects consumers but also supports the growth and innovation of the virtual assets sector,” said Matthew White, CEO of VARA.

“Our updated marketing regulations and the newly issued guidance document reflect our commitment to maintaining Dubai’s position as a global leader in digital finance. We believe that by providing clear and actionable guidance, we can help VASPs deliver their services responsibly while fostering greater trust and transparency in the market.”

At a recent panel discussion during Korea Blockchain Week (KBW2024) Binance CEO Richard Teng praised Dubai and its regulatory framework for digital assets.

Commenting on the Middle East, Teng pointed to innovative regulatory approaches in countries like Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, and Dubai. He praised Dubai’s establishment of VARA which is dedicated solely to overseeing the crypto industry.

A presale for a new Pepe-themed meme coin on its own Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain called Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) has passed the blue moon milestone of raising an eye-watering $15 million.

Pepe Unchained launched this summer to a wave of hype as meme coin fans bundled in to take advantage of virtually unheard-of staking rewards, alongside lower fees and 100x faster speeds for anyone transacting with $PEPU than its leading ERC-20 meme coin competitors.

There’s little more than a day left to purchase $PEPU at the lowest fixed presale price of $0.00985 before the presale moves on to the next round where the price rises to $0.00986. Those who buy in earlier maximize their potential rewards.

This month the team also shared an ecosystem roadmap in a multi-tweet thread over on X.

In the thread, the team promises a custom Layer 2 decentralized exchange (DEX) for cheap swaps between $PEPU and supported tokens, alongside a Pepe Foundation, which will help fund “an entire ecosystem with the best developers in the space contributing.”


Beyond the ICO, the token’s likely listing on exchanges could smash the ceiling on its potential appreciation, so for those who are curious, there may never be a better time to buy in, while an investment of $100 bags over 10,000 $PEPU.


Read on to find out how Pepe’s new Layer 2 token is rewarding its holders with more than just laughs and speculative potential.

Pepe Gets Unchained in $PEPU
The original Pepe (ticker: $PEPE) is the third-biggest meme coin in crypto with a $3.5 billion market cap.

Pepe was already famous four years before Bitcoin gave the world crypto in 2009. He was originally a character in the webcomic Boy’s Club, designed by Max Furie, and he was known for his catchphrase “feels good, man”.

Pepe then went on to become the star of memes, and even appeared in the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests. Since the meme coin $PEPE’s launch, other tokens inspired by Furie’s comic have dropped but none enjoyed quite the same success as the original.


Still, the capitalization power of the webcomic has attracted billions of dollars. The recently launched Brett coin ($BRETT) corners almost a billion of the market while $PEPE imitator $PEPECOIN’s market cap approaches half a billion today.

Clearly, the appeal of these viral coins lies in their potential to blow sky-high. If you had bought $PEPE one year ago today, your stash would be up 1,124%. $BRETT holders that bought during February’s launch are up nearly 9,000%. Meanwhile, diamond-handed $PEPECOIN HODLers are up an unbelievable 24,389% from this time last year, according to CoinGecko.

So what sets Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) apart from its three Boy’s Club predecessors? Unlike the other Pepe coins, which people hold to exploit their volatile and often rapid price rises, then sell for a quick buck, $PEPU’s features make it a meme coin made for HODLing (holding on for dear life).


Pepe’s New Layer 2 Capabilities and Tokenomics
Pepe Unchained is the first Pepe token to run on its own proprietary Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain.

Ethereum is the most commercially important blockchain, however, Ethereum can currently only process about 15 transactions per second (tps) which results in high network congestion and larger transaction fees.

To solve this, developers have created several Layer 2 protocols. Layer 2s sit on top of the main Ethereum network and process transactions independently on a side chain, before adding them to the Layer 1 blockchain ledger.

One famous Layer 2 is Polygon, represented by the $POL token (formerly $MATIC), which has a maximum recorded 429 tps.

Layer 2 protocol tokens have collectively amassed a market cap of over $20 billion.

Now Pepe Unchained, or $PEPU, is the first meme coin to utilize this technology, making it a hundred times quicker and cheaper to transact with than Ethereum.

Thanks to the improved scalability, which offloads work from the main chain, Pepe Unchained offers $PEPU stakers far greater rewards than Layer 1 meme coin counterparts, with a variable yield rate currently set at 139% APY.

The project arrives with a dedicated block explorer to see all transactions on the Layer 2. It also offers instant and low-cost bridging between Pepe Unchained and Ethereum’s Layer 1.


A total of 3.2 billion $PEPU, or two fifths of total supply of 8 billion $PEPU is allocated to the presale, with a hefty 30% (2.4 billion $PEPU) going towards staking.

A tenth is earmarked for the token’s marketing, while the remaining 20% is split equally between DEX liquidity, project development (both 7.5%), with the remaining 5% going into Pepe Unchained’s Layer 2 treasury.

Taurus, Aktionariat, SMEs
Taurus SA, a Swiss digital asset infrastructure provider backed by Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, has partnered with Swiss equity tokenization platform Aktionariat AG to create the first regulated secondary market for tokenized shares of small and midsize enterprises (SMEs).

According to the press release, Taurus will support selected shares tokenized with Aktionariat on the Ethereum blockchain.

At the same time, Aktionariat will offer a path for client companies to start trading on the Taurus Digital Exchange (TDX).

The companies become eligible for TDX admission as they grow in market capitalization and match specified criteria, Taurus said.

The collaboration will go live in November.

With that step, the first Aktionariat-tokenized SMEs will begin trading on TDX.


Meanwhile, the partnership combines Taurus’ institutional-grade trading technology with Aktionariat’s proficiency in tokenizing Swiss companies’ equity, it added.


The goal is to “increase liquidity and unlock value for tokenized SMEs and their shareholders by providing access to TDX’s network of banks, professional investors, and retail clients.”

Additionally, Taurus CMO Victor Busson commented that the collaboration helps create a strong ecosystem for issuers and investors. It “demonstrates how tokenization can increase liquidity and accessibility for the private capital market.”

RealUnit Schweiz is Among the First Issuers
Taurus argues that buying private security should be simple and “as straightforward as purchasing a book online.” This includes equity, debt, or other assets, including funds and real estate –

Thereforre, this latest partnership with Aktionariat matches Taurus’ broader vision of digitizing private markets and making private equity more accessible to investors, it said.

With that in mind, following the partnership, one of the first tokenized SMEs to be admitted for trading on TDX is the real-estate-focused investment company RealUnit Schweiz AG.

RealUnit tokenized its shares with Aktionariat in April 2022. It has enabled investors to hold the shares in any Ethereum-based wallet.

Additionally, the press release said that the company enabled a first in the Swiss capital market. Namely, it gave investors a choice between classic bearer shares and registered shares as tokens.

Taurus CMO Victor Busson commented that the securities firm is “particularly excited about the potential for companies like RealUnit to leverage our platform, showcasing the tangible benefits of tokenization for both issuers and investors.”

Per Taurus, several more companies will join in 2025 with the expansion of the tokenized SMEs ecosystem.

RealUnit CEO Dani Stüssi added that this is one of the first Swiss companies to offer tokenized instruments.

Trading on TDX is “a natural next step” in the company’s “journey to increase accessibility and liquidity” for its investors and to open up access to actively managed real asset investments.

Meanwhile, more than 30,000 registered shareholders and 70 issuers use Aktionariat, the company said.


Its product suite encompasses a portfolio app for investors, an automated shareholder registry for issuers, and web-based tools to “organize the relations” between the two.

Per CEO Murat Ögat, Aktionariat wants to enable companies to leverage the power of blockchain-based financing.

“While we already offer tools to enable the sale and limited informal trading of security tokens, there is a lack of licensed marketplaces for security tokens. Taurus fills this gap with its digital marketplace,” Ögat concluded.

Ethena to Release New Stablecoin Backed by Blackrock’s Fund on Ethereum
Ethena Labs, the developer of the Ethereum-based synthetic dollar protocol, has announced the launch of UStb, a new fiat stablecoin. Backed by the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUILD) and in partnership with Securitize Markets LLC, UStb offers a distinct alternative to the existing USDe stablecoin.

BUILD, BlackRock’s first tokenized fund launched in March 2024 on a public blockchain Ethereum, allows investors to earn interest in U.S. dollars through Securitize Markets LLC. Securitize Markets LLC specializes in tokenizing real-world assets (RWA), providing investors with the opportunity to access tokenized digital assets through innovative blockchain technology projects.

BUILD invests in U.S. Treasury bills, notes and other obligations and has rapidly grown to become the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury fund, currently accumulating over $522 million in assets under management (AUM).

Differentiated Risk Profile
UStb will be fully collateralized by BlackRock’s BUILD and Securitize, ensuring its stability and reliability. Functioning similarly to a traditional stablecoin, UStb will provide users and exchange partners with a familiar and secure asset.


As a separate product from USDe, UStb offers a differentiated risk profile. This allows users and exchange partners to choose the option that best aligns with their specific needs and risk tolerance.

“One initial concern surrounding USDe from the community has been how the protocol responds to negative funding rate environments,” said Ethena Labs in its X post from Sept. 27. However, “despite bearish conditions over the last 6 months Ethena’s USDe has not endured a single week of negative funding.”

To further mitigate risks, Ethena’s governance will have the flexibility to adjust the backing composition of USDe between basis positions and liquid stable products, potentially incorporating UStb during periods of weak funding.

As Ethena continues to expand its partnerships with centralized exchanges (CEXs) – beyond the current integrations with Bybit and Bitget, it will offer exchange partners the choice of two distinct stablecoin products for margin collateral: USDe and UStb.

However, Ethena will be sharing more details about UStb’s timeline and new exchange integrations in the near future.

USDe: A Synthetic Stablecoin with Unique Risks
Launched in February 2024, USDe, a synthetic dollar, quickly gained traction and became the fifth-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, according to DefiLlama data. As of Sept. 26, USDe has a circulating supply of $2.54 billion.

Ethena’s USDe is now the fifth-largest stablecoin

Unlike traditional stablecoins that rely on direct fiat or asset backing, USDe employs derivative hedging strategies to maintain its U.S. dollar peg. It uses Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), and other crypto assets as collateral, with an arbitrage-based system for minting and redeeming tokens. Additionally, USDe generates yields through a cash-and-carry strategy.

However, this approach introduces certain risks. USDe’s exposure to derivatives markets, exchange counterparty risk, and collateral volatility could potentially affect its peg stability during adverse market conditions.

On Aug. 5, amid a broader crypto market selloff, USDe faced a stress test with nearly $100 million in redemptions. While the stablecoin briefly dipped to $0.997, it quickly recovered to its $1 target.


On Sept. 18, Ethena Labs temporarily deactivated its frontend due to a security breach involving its domain registrar account.

XRP Whales Trigger Worry With $23.4M Token Shift – Is a Sell-off Coming?
XRP has dipped by 0.2% in the past 24 hours, slipping to $0.5895 as the cryptocurrency market barely moves today.

The alt remains up by a modest 1% in a week and by 9.5% in a fortnight, with these percentages coming in the context of increasing transfers of XRP to exchanges.

According to CryptoQuant data, traders have transferred 43 million XRP to Binance in the past couple of weeks, worth around $23.4 million.

This suggests that whales are still likelier to sell XRP at the moment than to buy it, meaning we may have to weather a few more dips before the cryptocurrency enjoyed a sustained renewal.

XRP Whales Trigger Worry With $23.4M Token Shift – Is a Sell-off Coming?
The aforementioned data shows that, on September 10, Binance held 2.941 billion XRP on behalf of its customers.

However, today it holds around 2.986 billion XRP, with this transfer happening during a period of growth for the XRP price.

While this would suggest that a selloff may be coming soon, it also shows how transfers to exchanges don’t result in immediate dips, given that the XRP price has risen by 9.5% in the last 14 days.


In fact, if you were to zoom out on this chart you would see that Binance’s reserve of XRP is still down on its 2024 high of 3.14 billion XRP, which it reached in March, when the coin rose as high as $0.719.

As such, it would be perhaps too negative to assume that we’ll see a big drop soon, especially when the altcoin’s circulating supply currently amounts to 56.505 billion.

Indeed, XRP’s chart continues to look promising, with its indicators currently on an upwards trajectory.

For instance, its relative strength index (purple) has jumped this morning from a low 30, rising above 50 and still showing some momentum.

Its 30-period moving average (orange) has also very recently bounced up from its 200-period average (blue), again suggesting that we may see a rally after today’s minor dip plays out.

It’s also positive that XRP’s 24-hour trading volume remains above $1 billion, indicating sustained interest in the coin.

When combined with the two major fundamental currents affecting the token – wider market positivity and Ripple’s renewed expansion – we should expect XRP to have a strong end to the year.

It may reach $0.60 in the next couple of weeks and potentially end the year at $0.80.

Presale Tokens Offer Quick Above-Average Gains
XRP is likely to remain one of the biggest tokens in the market for a long time, but its progress may be steady rather than spectacular.

If so, traders may be better off investigating newer tokens which can often outpace the market, including some of the more promising presale coins.

One of the hottest of these right now is DICE, the Solana-based native token of online casino Mega Dice, which has now raised over $1.8 million.


Launched last year, Mega Dice is already one of crypto’s biggest casinos, providing over 4,500 games and a competitive sportsbook.

Its status within the cryptocurrency gambling sector has clearly boosted the presale for DICE, which will provide holders with numerous benefits.

Not only is it the payment token for Mega Dice’s platform, but it will give owners access to exclusive games and bonuses.

It has a max supply of 420 million tokens, with a percentage of this being distributed via a post-presale airdrop worth $2.25 million.


It’s exciting to note the size of Mega Dice’s community, with the platform having over 14,000 members on Telegram and more than 27,000 on X.

Investors can join its sale by going to the Mega Dice website, where DICE currently sells at $0.116056 per token.

Early signs would suggest that it will rise much higher than this once it lists in the next couple of months.

In a recent interview, billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban expressed interest in becoming the Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which Gary Gensler currently holds.

Cuban’s declaration comes when the crypto industry heavily scrutinizes the SEC for its regulatory approach, particularly under Gensler’s leadership.

Prominent figures such as lawyer John Deaton support the idea, seeing Cuban as a potential “breath of fresh air” compared to Gensler’s “lawlessness.”

Mark Cuban On The Next SEC Chair: When Is Gary Gensler Resigning?
During an interview with FOX News, Cuban was asked whether he would be interested in positions like Treasury Secretary or Commerce Secretary in a future Kamala Harris administration, which would face Donald Trump in the upcoming elections.


Cuban, however, made it clear that he would only take on the role of SEC Chair.

“Head of the SEC, that is the job I would take.”

This statement has resonated with many in the crypto space, particularly those dissatisfied with Gensler’s regulatory policies.


John Deaton, a prominent pro-XRP lawyer, was quick to support Cuban’s potential leadership of the SEC.

Deaton emphasized Cuban’s firsthand experience facing the SEC’s “overreach,” referencing the time when Cuban fought back against what he described as the SEC’s bullying tactics and eventually won his legal battle in 2013.

Deaton has also been vocal about Gensler’s regulatory actions, especially toward the cryptocurrency sector, describing Gensler’s leadership as “destructive” and “lawless.”


Cuba’s stance on the SEC’s treatment of the crypto industry is well-known.

He has consistently criticized the agency’s failure to provide clear regulatory guidelines for cryptocurrency companies.

Infact, he recently commented Rep. Ritchie Torres’s post on X, which was about the SEC approach to claiming NFTs as securities, he criticited the misclassification and even tweeted:


Cuban’s Potential Impact on the SEC: A Great Reform
Cuban’s involvement in the crypto industry and his experience in confronting the SEC have led many to believe he could bring meaningful changes if appointed SEC Chair.

Cuban has repeatedly called for clearer guidelines to allow cryptocurrency firms to operate within the framework of federal securities laws, and his leadership could offer a more balanced regulatory approach.


He has criticized the SEC for its differential treatment of crypto-related financial products compared to more traditional markets.

He claimed he had invested in several digital currencies, experienced the market’s volatility firsthand, and even suffered significant losses from crypto scams.

His candid approach to the crypto world has earned him both respect and attention from the industry.

Beyond Cuban, other crypto-friendly figures have been mentioned as possible replacements for Gensler.

One notable name is SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, often called “Crypto Mom” for her support of digital assets.

Gensler has been criticized for his aggressive enforcement actions against the crypto industry, with U.S.

Gensler’s approach, which has focused on treating many digital assets as securities and pursuing legal action against firms that allegedly violate securities laws, has caused significant tension in the industry.

Many in the crypto community, including Cuban, argue that the SEC’s lack of clarity and guidance stifles innovation and drives crypto companies overseas.

Notably, reports have indicated that Gensler will most likely resign from the office as soon as next year should current U.S. President Joe Biden’s exit from the 2024 presidential race lead to a change in administration.

The Worldcoin Foundation and its partner, Tools for Humanity (TFH), were fined a total of $860,000 by South Korea’s Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) on Thursday for violations related to the collection and transfer of biometric data.


According to the announcement published by the PIPC, the organizations were penalized for improperly collecting iris data without adequate consent and for failing to inform users about the transfer of their data abroad.

South Korea Fines Worldcoin Foundation and TFH
The investigation, initiated in February, found that the Worldcoin Foundation and TFH collected sensitive biometric information from nearly 30,000 individuals in South Korea without meeting the legal requirements for data processing.

The Commission highlighted that the information provided to users about the data collection and its purpose was insufficient and only available in English until March 2024, which further contributed to the lack of proper consent.

Both parties were also criticized for not having a robust deletion process for iris data and for failing to implement age verification procedures for users under 14.


In response to the violations, the Worldcoin Foundation and TFH have been instructed to obtain separate and explicit consent for the processing of sensitive data, to ensure data is not used beyond its original purpose, and to enhance their data deletion capabilities upon user request.

The commission emphasized the importance of compliance with data protection laws, especially as the use of biometric data becomes more prevalent.

World ID Verification Expands to Three More Countries
Worldcoin has recently expanded its World ID verification services to Guatemala, Malaysia, and Poland, targeting the demand for advanced methods to distinguish between human users and bots in cyberspace.


The organization stated that several surveys conducted in various regions have indicated the growing demand for human verification services, responding to new threats posted by AI-powered bots.

South Korea’s PIPC decision sends a clear message: compliance with data protection laws is non-negotiable.

For Worldcoin and TFH, correcting these missteps will be essential as they pursue global expansion.

NEIRO Price Analysis: Whale Buys $1.53M as NEIRO Jumps 215% – What's Next?
The NEIRO price has dived by 14% in the past 24 hours, dipping to $0.001038 as the wider cryptocurrency market moves by 0% today.

Despite this noticeable correction, NEIRO remains up by a healthy 21% in a week and by a whopping 3,000% in a month, with the Ethereum-based meme coin exploding since Binance announced its listing for it on September 15.

While it has lost some momentum in the past day, it remains very much in demand, with a whale buying $1.53 million of the coin this week.

This would indicate that further rallies aren’t too far away, particularly if more exchanges list the new alt.

NEIRO Price Analysis: Whale Buys $1.53M as NEIRO Jumps 215% – What’s Next?
After dipping over the past day, it looks as though the NEIRO price is ready to bounce back up again quite soon.

Its current price has fallen below its 30-period moving average (orange) is about to bounce off its support level (green), which has risen significantly this week.


It’s also interesting that NEIRO’s 30-period average has now been below the 200-period average (blue) for a couple of weeks, implying that the token has actually been in an undervalued position for too long.

NEIRO price chart.
Source: TradingView
However, it’s not clear when a rebound will arrive, with NEIRO’s relative strength index (purple) struggling to climb above 50, which is where it would gain real momentum.

Having said that, this week has seen whales begin stocking up on the meme coin again, with one particular trading sitting on a small fortune of 17.71 million NEIRO.

One other whale has now accumulated accumulated $2.96 million in NEIRO, indicating the growing belief that the coin will rally strongly again soon.


And there’s good reason to believe that NEIRO will experience other enviable rallies soon, given that it hasn’t yet listed on numerous major exchanges (e.g. Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, OKX).

Additional major listings will push it even higher, as we saw with the Binance announcement.

What’s also encouraging is that Neiro’s emergence as a new major meme coin has coincided with a rejuvenation of the wider cryptocurrency market.

This began last week, when the Federal Reserve reduced its funds rate by 0.5%, improving investor sentiment.

And with a couple more cuts expected this year, the NEIRO price could end up very high.

It may top its current ATH of $0.001327 by the middle of October, and potentially end the year at $0.0025.

New High-Potential Altcoins for Quicker Gains
NEIRO won’t be the only new token outperforming the market this fall, however, with several newer coins also looking very promising at the moment.

This includes several presale coins, with new ERC-20 coin Memebet Token (MEMEBET) now raising over $290,000 in its recently opened sale.


Memebet Token is planning to launch its own online crypto-friendly casino, with MEMEBET serving as its official utility coin.

Its casino will offer over 1,000 crypto-native games, covering classic casino table games and slots, as well as sports betting.

While users will be able to bet using established meme tokens such as Pepe, Dogecoin, Bonk and Shiba Inu, they will gain bigger rewards and bonuses if they use MEMEBET.

This creates a strong incentive to buy and hold MEMEBET, with the demand likely to help the coin’s price grow over time.

It has a relatively low max supply of 2 billion, with 70% going to the presale, 20% to casino rewards and 10% to liquidity.


Investors can get involved in the sale by going to the official Memebet Token website, where 1 MEMEBET token costs $0.0254.

This price will rise on numerous occasions before the sale ends, so interested buyers should act now, so as to lock in the lowest possible price.

Bitcoin price is showing renewed strength, trading near $64,583 after benefiting from recent global economic developments. Notably, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has introduced a new stimulus package to boost its slowing economy, which could significantly impact the cryptocurrency market.


Historically, increased liquidity from central banks has driven demand for riskier assets like Bitcoin. With China’s economic stimulus adding to global liquidity and the potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts, market analysts are speculating whether Bitcoin could be on the verge of hitting new all-time highs.

However, concerns about the broader economic outlook and ongoing global uncertainties could also influence Bitcoin’s price trajectory.

How China’s Economic Stimulus Could Affect Bitcoin’s Price
The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has introduced a major stimulus package, the largest since the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes lowering reserve requirements for banks and cutting mortgage rates by 50 basis points.

Some believe this influx of liquidity could benefit Bitcoin, similar to how past Federal Reserve rate cuts boosted Bitcoin’s price. After the announcement, Bitcoin saw a modest rise from $63,000 to $64,500.


However, despite the stimulus, analysts remain cautious.

Crypto trading has been banned in mainland China since 2021.
Consumer confidence remains weak, limiting Bitcoin’s growth potential.
While liquidity might help, experts expect a minimal immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price.

Bitcoin Price Boosted by Strong U.S. Data and Potential Fed Rate Cuts
Bitcoin is trading above $64,500, bolstered by positive U.S. economic data. Key figures such as a steady 3% GDP, slightly better than the expected 2.9%, and lower-than-expected unemployment claims of 218,000 (vs. 222,000) have eased concerns about economic contraction.


However, continuing unemployment claims rose to 1.834 million, surpassing forecasts, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to rethink its approach to interest rate cuts.


The odds of a 50 basis point cut at the Fed’s November 7 meeting have increased to 63%, further supporting Bitcoin’s price outlook.

Arthur Hayes: Quantitative Easing to Boost Bitcoin and Crypto Markets
Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, predicts that global quantitative easing (QE) will drive Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies higher.

As governments print more money to stabilize their economies, Hayes believes much of this liquidity will flow into Bitcoin, making it a hedge against excessive government spending.


Hayes advises investors to accumulate Bitcoin by earning, mining, or borrowing fiat at low rates but warns against using leverage, citing potential risks.

While optimistic about Bitcoin’s performance in easing monetary conditions, he cautions that volatility could return, creating financial instability.

A breakout above these levels could push Bitcoin toward fresh highs. On the downside, immediate support rests at $64,423, with further backing at $63,802 and $63,530, where the 50-day EMA aligns, offering robust support for the uptrend.


The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 67.90, nearing overbought territory, which may signal short-term profit-taking.

Meanwhile, the 50-day EMA at $63,530 remains a key, indicating continued bullish momentum as long as BTC holds above this mark.

VanEck Sets $330 Solana Price Target: Can It Challenge Ethereum?
Over the past 24 hours, Solana has reaffirmed a break above the $150 resistance threshold with a 1.38% rise. This victory comes as VanEck sets a $330 Solana price target, citing its potential to challenge Ethereum’s dominance.

Indeed, Solana appears to have settled into a new bullish trajectory, maintaining a 9.7% markup since Thursday’s Fed-rate-fueled breakout, making it one of the best performers among other notable altcoins.

This positive momentum is also reflected in a 26.72% drop in trading volume, now at $2.075 billion, suggesting that recent volatility is beginning to ease.

Solana vs Ethereum: Metrics Drive Bullish Forecast
In a September 25th report, Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, highlighted Solana as undervalued, projecting its potential to capture up to 50% of Ethereum’s current market capitalization and a valuation of $330.

This bullish outlook is driven primarily by Solana’s unrecognized superior speed and transaction processing metrics.

The Solana network’s throughput exceeds that of Ethereum by over 3,000%, enabling it to process thousands of transactions per second (TPS). Additionally, Solana boasts over 1,300% more daily active users compared to Ethereum, benefiting from transaction fees that are a staggering 5,000,000% cheaper on its network.

Sigel argues that Solana’s stark advantage in speed and cost efficiency gives it a significant edge over Ethereum for payments and remittances.


He specifically notes the potential for stablecoins to leverage Solana’s superior processing capabilities, potentially passing on substantial cost savings to users.

The ‘Lag’ Keeping SOL Behind: Can the Solana Price Push to $330?
As retail investors are “slowly waking up” to Solana’s potential to challenge Ethereum as a smart contract platform, VanEck noted a puzzling “lag” in institutional adoption despite these technological advantages.

Sigel attributed this gap to a hesitancy among institutions to transition from established “blue-chip” assets like Ethereum in favor of the relatively younger Solana.

While Ethereum continues to benefit from its first-mover advantage, VanEck’s analysis suggests this lead may be eroding quickly as users increasingly shift to faster layer-1 networks, with Solana being a significant contender in this movement.

As the crypto market continues to develop, Solana’s technological prowess could position it for significant growth in the coming months. Notably, technical indicators lend credibility to this prospect.

Most significantly, the formation of a cup and handle pattern since late 2021 favors a bullish continuation of Solana’s long-term price appreciation, indicating a temporary pause in a prevailing uptrend.

Currently, Solana remains bound within the channel that forms the handle, consolidating before its next move amid the current uncertain market sentiment.

However, a breakout from this channel seems more credible this week, as the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has entered positive territory at +0.13. It joins the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which retains its bullish lean just above neutral – indicative of prevailing buying pressure.

This reaffirms the MACD line’s bullish trajectory, nearing a crossover with the signal line, which could see the bulls lead the next push.

With a breakout of the upper bound of the handle, VanEck’s price target of $330 becomes credible, with the potential to exceed that mark and approach $400.

This New Opportunity Has Higher Gains Potential
Although traders may want to cling to this Solana opportunity, it is unlikely to unfold in the near term, and much less so quickly.

Therefore, investors looking to maximize their gains potential may find a strategic advantage in diversifying into newer low-cap meme coins that have the potential to rally exponentially.

Notably, Memebet Casino’s $MEMEBET token presale is off to a strong start, raising almost $300,000 for its new Telegram-based betting platform pioneering meme coins betting.

Crypto enthusiasts are excited about the platform, which offers high stakes, a global sportsbook featuring major leagues like EPL and NBA, and a wide range of crypto-native games.

It is designed specifically with degens in mind, which is precisely why it has quickly attracted substantial capital, including a $50,000 whale purchase.


While other meme coins like Dogecoin, Pepe, Shiba Inu, and Floki – with more on the way – can be used for wagers, the $MEMEBET token is central to the ecosystem and is the only one that enhances the gaming experience for every degen player.

Using $MEMEBET tokens unlocks a range of benefits, including airdrop rewards, special degen bonuses, and access to the upcoming Memebet Casino Lootboxes, featuring real-world prizes and valuable casino bonuses.

Furthermore, Memebet Casino incorporates a play-to-earn (P2E) wagering element, offering higher rewards to players who wager more on the platform.
An estimated $409 million was stolen by crypto hackers in the third quarter of 2024, Immunefi revealed in a report this week.

The amount reflects ongoing attacks on both centralized and decentralized platforms, with some prominent exchanges and protocols hit particularly hard.

Crypto Hacks Lead to Massive Losses in Q3 2024
The Immunefi report highlights that over $3 million of the stolen sum was traced to hacks at Singapore-based crypto exchange BingX and Indian crypto exchange WazirX, with these incidents accounting for 69.5% of the quarter’s total losses.

As DeFi continues to grow, with over $87 billion in total value locked, the threat from hackers shows no signs of slowing.

This quarter saw hacks account for 99.25% of total funds lost, while fraud represented just 0.75%. Fraud cases saw a notable decrease year over year, dropping by 86.4%.

This $409 million figure represents a 40% decrease from the same quarter in 2023, which recorded losses of over $685 million to hackers and fraudsters.

Immunefi Report Exposes Major Hacks
Several high-profile attacks in Q3 2024 contributed to the immense losses.


Penipe protocol suffered a $27 million breach, Indodex faced a $22 million loss, Ronin lost $12 million, LI.FI Protocol saw $10 million stolen, and Bittensor experienced an $8 million hack.


The Immunefi report underscores the growing threat of crypto hacks, with these incidents revealing critical vulnerabilities across both CeFi and DeFi platforms.

The Growing Risk to CeFi and DeFi
While DeFi saw a higher number of incidents, CeFi was responsible for more severe losses, with some individual attacks leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen assets.

“We’re seeing a higher number of incidents targeting DeFi, while CeFi experiences fewer incidents but often with more severe consequences, with hundreds of millions in stolen funds in a single exploit,” said Mitchell Amador, Immunefi founder and CEO.

Amador further explained that private key management remains one of the biggest vulnerabilities in CeFi. “It requires rigorous key management policies, practices, and emergency plans,” she added.

In response to these mounting incidents, some exchanges like WazirX are already taking steps to recover from losses and rebuild.

WazirX Takes Steps to Recover
The report coincides with the High Court of Singapore’s decision to grant WazirX a four-month restructuring moratorium, giving the company time to restore affected clients’ crypto balances and adjust its operating protocols.


“We know the cyberattack has caused hardship for everyone, and we feel the weight of this burden alongside you. Please know that we are working tirelessly to bring a faster resolution and ease the pain this has caused,” WazirX founder Nischal Shetty said in a September 26 X post.

Shetty emphasized that the company remains committed to transparency and rebuilding trust with its users. “As we move forward, our commitment remains strong—to ensure transparency, rebuild trust, and create a future where we emerge more resilient together.”

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Pushes Above $66K After Soft US Inflation - Here’s Where Its Headed Next
1 day ago
Popular meme coin Popcat ($POPCAT) has just hit a $1 billion market cap in the midst of a rally that has added 59% its price over the last two weeks.

According to the data, Popcat is currently trading at $1.04, which spells all round gains for recent buyers after the token rose about 3% in the last 24 hours and about 17% over the last week.

Altogether, Popcat has risen to become the seventh biggest meme coin by market cap after formerly holding tenth place.

What’s Behind Popcat’s Explosive Surge? A Meme Coin Rally!
However, while Popcat may be surging right now, it’s not the best performing among the ten biggest meme coins. Two cryptocurrencies grew more than 30% over the last seven days.

Solana’s DogWifHat ($WIF) rose 30% to $2.22, while Mog Coin ($MOG) rose 38.5% to $0.051498.

In general, meme coins surged last night.


According to data by CoinCodex, the sector rose 7.2% in the last 24 hours and now has a market cap of $50.8 billion.

By contrast, the wider $2.37 trillion crypto market remains virtually unchanged from yesterday, although the $1.27 trillion cap sector leader Bitcoin ($BTC) rose 1.2% overnight and 3.1% over the week to trade at $64,375.

According to Popcat’s price chart, the token is now trading at a three-month high as it keeps its head above $1.

A rising relative strength index (RSI) of 62 together with the fact that Popcat is trading about five cents above its 30-day moving average are telltale signs that the rally has almost run its course, but Popcat will likely remain at its current level going into next week.

What To Do With Meme Coins? Now You Can Bet Them!
Popcat’s successful week is a reminder of the kind of market fervor that propels meme coins quickly up the tables.

However, beyond explosive price rises, even the most ardent meme coin fans have trouble articulating the economic utility of their favorite funny tokens.

However, one ascendant new project called Memebet hopes to change that by turning meme coins into casino chips.

It has quietly raised well over a quarter of a million dollars in under a fortnight thanks to its first-of-its-kind premise: it’s the web’s first online casino where players use meme coins.

The presale launched last week and the $MEMEBET token received over $200,000 in investments in just two days.

With online gambling primed to explode from a $100 billion industry in 2024 to $130 billion within the next five years alongside the growing adoption of crypto, $MEMEBET is positioned to take advantage of both emerging technologies, unlike Sui Network.


$MEMEBET tokens unlock a range of benefits for players, including airdrop rewards, special VIP degen bonuses, and access to the upcoming Memebet Casino Lootboxes, featuring real-world prizes and casino bonuses.

The project also launched a 400 million $MEMEBET airdrop.

To join, simply buy some tokens, wait for the launch of the casino (before the end of the presale), and begin gaming and betting to secure rewards.
Ireland is collaborating with EU partners and authorities to align on MiCA regulation, central bank deputy governor Derville Rowland said on Monday.

“For the first time, MiCAR will introduce a harmonised regulatory framework for the sector that introduces prudential and conduct obligations for issuers of e-money tokens, asset-referenced tokens, and for crypto-asset service providers,” Rowland said. “There are also obligations for offers to the public of crypto-assets other than asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens.”

The EU crafted MiCA to unify crypto-asset regulations across member states. Prior to MiCA, crypto rules differed greatly, fragmenting the market. Now, the framework seeks to standardize these rules, promoting market cohesion and minimizing regulatory discrepancies.


Rowland said that the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) are pushing for a unified approach to implementing MiCA across national authorities.

“We see this as highly important work. MiCAR, being a first attempt at regulation in this area, is an important opportunity to avoid divergent approaches emerging in different jurisdictions,” she added.

Crypto Adoption Grows in Ireland as Businesses Embrace Digital Payments
Ireland hosts a wide range of businesses, from crypto exchanges to blockchain startups. Crypto interest is particularly strong among young, tech-savvy individuals and finance professionals exploring new investments.


More businesses in Ireland are adopting crypto payments, fueled by global digital currency trends and the potential for lower transaction costs.

Ireland Ranks High for Crypto Firms Seeking MiCA Compliance
Earlier this year, Steven Eisenhauer, Ramp’s chief risk and compliance officer, highlighted Ireland as a top destination for crypto companies. He pointed out that despite its small size, Ireland hosts about 12 virtual asset service providers.

Further, he estimated that around half of crypto firms preparing for MiCA consider Ireland, alongside France, Germany and Belgium, as potential bases.

Binance’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and its Indonesian subsidiary Tokocrypto worked with Indonesia’s Criminal Investigation Agency Bareskrim, to crack down on crypto fraud in the region.

A recent investigation has led to the arrest of multiple suspects and the seizure of approximately $200,000 in fraudulent funds.

Bareskrim is the criminal investigation agency of Indonesia’s national police. It is the central executive agency responsible for investigating major crimes, including financial fraud, cybercrime, and organized crime.

Earlier this month, Tokocrypto, secured a Physical Crypto Asset Trader (PFAK) license from Indonesia’s commodity regulator, Bappebti.

Bareskrim Identifies Pig Butchering Scams
The investigation began when Bareskrim identified a suspected crypto trading website as a front for fraudulent operations, part of a broader scam known as a “pig butchering scam.”

These scams typically involve long-term deception where fraudsters manipulate victims into making substantial investments under the guise of legitimate trading, only to steal their funds.


Chainalysis released a mid-year update on crypto crime in August, revealing a big rise in pig butchering scams within the cryptocurrency market in 2024.

Reports indicated that the fraudulent website was facilitating illegal transactions, this in turn prompted Bareskrim to act. During the investigation, law enforcement arrested several individuals responsible for managing the accounts used to launder the stolen funds.

The Indonesian authorities seized over 50 mobile phones, numerous local bank cards, and banking apps found on the suspects’ devices. Bareskrim investigators found wallet addresses likely controlled by the suspects, with supporting evidence found through their use of Telegram.

Despite their refusal to cooperate, forensic analysis allowed investigators to uncover key evidence, including crypto wallet addresses and communication records, particularly from the suspects’ Telegram chats.

Collaboration with Binance and Tokocrypto
Bareskrim contacted Tokocrypto, Indonesia’s prominent crypto exchange for assistance. Due to the complexity of the case, Tokocrypto referred the investigation to Binance’s FIU, which specializes in analyzing and tracking illicit crypto activity.

“Because we keep an open communication channel for global law enforcement agencies, we were able to connect with Bareskrim, leading to valuable actions,” said Nils Andersen Röed, Head of Binance FIU.

By working together, we can leverage our combined expertise to effectively track and seize illicit funds, ensuring that the cryptocurrency ecosystem remains secure and trustworthy,” said Röed.

Sam Bankman-Fried's Neurodivergence Disorders Impacted Trial, Doctors Say
Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial may have been significantly affected by his neurodivergence disorders, according to a group of doctors who submitted an amicus brief in support of his appeal.

The FTX co-founder, who has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), faced “serious challenges” during the court proceedings, the doctors told the Second Circuit Appeals Court.

The brief, signed by eight doctors specializing in neurodivergence, highlighted that several rulings during the trial were detrimental to Bankman-Fried due to his conditions.

Criticism Might Have Impacted SBF’s Answers
A key concern was the Manhattan district court’s decision to allow government prosecutors to cross-examine Bankman-Fried without a jury present before he took the stand in front of jurors.

This ruling, they argued, had “potentially profound effects” on his ability to communicate effectively during the trial.

The doctors noted that the judge repeatedly criticized Bankman-Fried for his lengthy answers and attempts to clarify or rephrase questions, behaviors that are common in individuals with ASD, who often interpret language literally.


They stated that this criticism led Bankman-Fried to adjust his responses before the jury, resulting in extremely brief, often one-word answers, such as “Yup,” which could be misinterpreted as arrogance or indifference.


The brief also pointed out that the lack of access to essential FTX documents and proper ADHD medication further hindered Bankman-Fried’s ability to defend himself.

The doctors explained that individuals with ASD often rely on concrete documentation to anchor their responses.

The absence of such materials can leave them appearing uncertain or evasive, which could have influenced the jury’s perception of Bankman-Fried during the trial.

Additionally, the doctors highlighted the impact of inadequate ADHD medication on Bankman-Fried’s performance.

For the first three weeks of the trial, he was not provided with the necessary extended-release medication doses required to maintain focus.

This deprivation, they argued, likely affected his ability to engage effectively in the proceedings, potentially leading to withdrawal symptoms that further impaired his concentration.

Law Professors Express Concern About SFB’s Trial
The amicus brief also coincided with another filing by a group of bankruptcy law professors who expressed concerns about the intersection of FTX’s bankruptcy case and Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial.

Although they did not take a stance supporting either side, the professors argued that the cooperation between the FTX bankruptcy estate and the prosecution could set a “dangerous precedent,” encouraging the use of Chapter 11 proceedings to bolster parallel criminal prosecutions.

They pointed out that the assistance provided by the FTX bankruptcy estate to the prosecutors was “extraordinary compared to previous cases” such as Enron and WorldCom in the early 2000s.

The professors also criticized the rapid pace of Bankman-Fried’s trial, which, they claimed, led jurors to believe — erroneously — that FTX customers would receive no compensation.

This was despite the fact that, as of May, the FTX estate had stated it had enough assets to repay creditors, with potentially billions in compensation available.

Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March for defrauding FTX customers of $11 billion.
Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram, has made a change to the messaging app’s security and privacy policies which involves handing over users’ IP addresses and numbers to authorities upon request.

In an update to its terms of service, Telegram said it will now hand over information to authorities who present valid legal requests, such as search warrants.

This policy shift marks a major development for the platform, which has built its reputation on robust privacy features.

Telegram’s updated terms of service now include a new section (8.3) under “Law Enforcement Authorities.” – this states:

If Telegram receives a valid order from the relevant judicial authorities that confirms you’re a suspect in a case involving criminal activities that violate the Telegram Terms of Service, we will perform a legal analysis of the request and may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities. If any data is shared, we will include such occurrences in a quarterly transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.

Telegram — (8.3) under “Law Enforcement Authorities.
Telegram previously positioned itself as a strong advocate for user privacy and security. The platform, which has over 700 million active users, has often been viewed as a haven for those seeking encrypted communications, free from government surveillance.


The new policy, however, suggests that Telegram is now willing to cooperate with law enforcement under certain conditions.

Telegram CEO Arrest, Censorship-Resistant Era Over
Durov was arrested at an airport on the outskirts of Paris, France, on Aug. 24. The Russian-born billionaire was charged with many crimes, including complicity in drug trafficking, dissemination of child pornography, fraud, money laundering, and illegal provision of cryptographic services. Since Durov’s release, Telegram has been facing pressure from governments to share user data.

Daria Lysenko, a crypto lawyer with the law firm SBSB, recently said the regulatory environment is shifting, and tech companies like Telegram may be forced to comply with the government’s demands to share private user information.

Debate on Free Speech
Since Durov’s arrest, there has been a huge debate around free speech. Meredith Whittaker, the president of privacy-focused U.S-based social network Signal, Durov’s arrest shows that tech companies are “looking at a very volatile geopolitical environment,” Wired reported.

Swedish Police Label Crypto Exchanges as 'Professional Money Launderers' in Crackdown
The Swedish Police Authority, in collaboration with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), has labeled certain cryptocurrency exchanges as “professional money launderers” (PMLs) in a recent crackdown targeting unlicensed and illegal operators.

According to the FIU, these exchanges are suspected of having criminal ties and facilitating systematic money laundering for individuals and organized crime networks.

In its analysis, the FIU classified PMLs into four distinct profiles based on their operational characteristics, including node exchange providers, hawala exchange providers, asset exchange providers, and platform exchange providers.


FIU Advocates for Crypto Regulation
The FIU highlighted the need for enhanced law enforcement presence and intervention on crypto trading platforms to combat these illicit activities.

“FIU Sweden assesses illicit cryptocurrency providers as an emerging threat within money laundering schemes and a crucial part for organized crime to maintain and expand their criminal markets,” the report stated.


While cracking down on illegal activities, Swedish authorities also acknowledged the positive role of licensed and legitimate crypto exchanges in mitigating money laundering risks.

They urged these compliant platforms to remain vigilant, monitor suspicious trading patterns, and take proactive measures such as halting suspicious transactions and offboarding clients involved in illegal activities.

In a parallel effort, Sweden has also been targeting tax evasion within its Bitcoin mining community.

A recent investigation by the Swedish Tax Agency revealed that 18 out of 21 crypto-mining firms had submitted misleading or incomplete tax information between 2020 and 2023.

The discrepancies reportedly led to an estimated $90 million in unpaid taxes.

The tax authority further expressed concerns regarding potential money laundering activities.

Due to their exclusion from the Money Laundering Act, crypto mining data centers currently operate outside the scope of regulatory oversight, which raises the risk of illicit financial transactions.

The tax agency’s findings resulted in legal appeals from the affected mining companies.

Two firms succeeded in reducing their liabilities, and the court said that “the amounts above have been adjusted with regard to the verdicts.”

Western Europe Leads in Crypto Adoption
As reported, Western Europe has emerged as a leading region in global crypto adoption, attracting a substantial number of daily traders, ranging from 1.2 million to 1.5 million individuals.

Germany and France are at the forefront of activity in the region, while Austria has experienced the most significant yearly growth, witnessing a remarkable 70% surge in users.

Notably, Gen Z and Millennials are at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption in Europe, according to a YouGov research commissioned by crypto exchange Bitpanda.

The survey analyzed five countries, including Switzerland, Austria, France, Germany, and Italy.

The survey identified Switzerland as the leading nation in digital currency ownership, with 23% of its population owning digital currencies.

This is followed by Austria at 18% and France at 14%. Germany and Italy lag behind with 11% and 9%, respectively.
The European Central Bank (ECB) official Piero Cipollone has outlined the benefits of a digital euro, stressing how it would bolster Europe’s financial sovereignty and resilience.

Speaking at the Committee hearing on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Cipollone highlighted the digital form of euro’s “tangible benefits” to all stakeholders.

“It would empower Europe to independently develop and manage digital payment solutions,” he stressed.


A digital euro would represent central bank money in digital format (CBDC), offering an efficient and inclusive payment solution.

Cipollone said that the CBDC project, which started in 2021, is at the “midpoint of the preparation phase.” He hinted that the project preparation has roughly one more year to go.


This aligns with the ECB President Christine Lagarde’s forecast to launch the CBDC before her term ends in 2027. Additionally, she stressed that a it should be “fit for the future.”

The project focuses on developing a methodology for determining the maximum holding limit for digital euro per person, Cipollone added.

“The holding limits are important to ensure financial stability and prevent large-scale transfers from bank deposits to digital euro, especially during crises.”

Further, the bank is also working to finalise the digital euro rulebook, which would provide a “clear set of rules and standards to ensure a consistent user experience across the euro area.”

Besides, the ECB is also in the process of selecting potential providers to develop a CBDC infrastructure. In addition to that, the project is also undergoing strict technical runs to check privacy and offline functionality.

Digital Euro Benefits Consumers, Merchants, Banks
“Consumers could use a digital euro for all payments, everywhere in the euro area, also when shopping online.”

Additionally, making or receiving payments with digital euros would be free of charge and accessible to everyone across the eurozone. This would also ensure user privacy and data protection, Cipollone said.

For merchants, a digital form of central bank-issued cash would cut the costs involved in international card schemes.

“A digital euro would include safeguards for merchants by capping the fees they pay to banks for processing payments.”

When it comes to banks, Cipollone noted that a digital euro would open up a new source of revenue. Also, banks would be responsible for distributing the CBDC, thus serving as a point of contact for users.
The Pepe price has risen by 2% in the past hour, reaching $0.000008195 as the cryptocurrency market actually falls by 4% in the past day.

PEPE is now up by 12% in a week, and while it remains down by 7% in a month, it sits on a highly enviable 1,100% increase in the last 12 months.

And its mini-surge today comes as its trading volume tops $1 billion, with whales having resumed accumulating the meme tokens in recent weeks.

This points to incoming price gains, particularly as the market is now heating up in its approach to the end of the year.

Pepe Price Rally Ahead? $1.1 Billion Volume Buys the Dip – Can PEPE Reach $1?
PEPE’s big spike today find the coin regaining some momentum, after a so-so start to the week.

Its relative strength index (purple) has jumped beyond 60 after falling to 40 this morning, signalling the influx of buyers.

Source: TradingView
Similarly, its 30-period moving average (orange) has begun rising further above its 200-day average (blue), a sign that PEPE remains firmly within a period of expansion.


Indeed, its volume has ballooned today, and what’s also encouraging is that its resistance (red) and support (green) levels are close to colliding with each other.

This suggests that the Pepe price may see a breakout later in the week after a possible (and small) correction today.

Looking at the bigger picture, the meme token has seen a return in accumulation over the past few weeks, after a relatively quiet August.


This offers an indication that whales expect PEPE to return to growth very soon, and given that it has been one of 2024’s best-performing tokens, it has enough medium- and long-term momentum to end the year strongly.

It will take strength in this respect from the market’s improving mood, with the Fed’s rate cut helping things last week.

And more generally, it does seem that PEPE is likely to remain the favored major meme coin among whales for some time to come, meaning that it will continue to outperform its top-100 rivals.

The Pepe price could therefore reach $0.000010 as soon as next week, before ending the year at around $0.000015.

The Pepe Coin with Fundamentals
There’s really only one issue with Pepe, which is that as a meme token, it lacks the fundamentals to support its price after whales lose interest in it as a profit vehicle.

For this reason, many traders may also opt to invest in alts with decent fundamentals, with several new coins and presale tokens combining meme-appeal with actual utility.

One of these is new layer-two project Pepe Unchained (PEPU), which has raised an impressive $14.9 million in its ongoing sale.


Pepe Unchained’s layer-two network will provide all-but instant transactions and competitively low fees, with its platform focusing on becoming an ecosystem for meme coins.

Because of its speed and scalability, Pepe Unchained will also be able to offer double the usual staking rewards.

This will incentivize greater ownership of PEPU and greater involvement in its network, with the coin having a max supply of 8 billion PEPU.

And as a Pepe-themed meme token, it’s very encouraging to note that the coin’s X account now has more than 18,000 followers.

Combined with its impressive raise, this signals considerable early interest in the project.

Investors can get involved in PEPU’s sale at the coin’s official website, where they can buy PEPU using either ETH, BNB, USDT or fiat currency.

It’s currently available at a price of $0.00984, with this price rising again tomorrow.

Of course, it could rise much higher once it lists on exchanges, given its current momentum.
Upbit, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has revealed plans to store user data on Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers located in the United States starting October 1.

In an announcement, the exchange said the decision, which comes as part of a change in its privacy policy, is intended to bolster service reliability and address privacy and regulatory considerations.

Upbit said it seeks to enhance the continuity, scalability, and security of its services by leveraging AWS’s globally recognized infrastructure.

Major Exchanges Adopt AWS for Data Storage
The move by Upbut comes as major exchanges like Coinbase have also adopted AWS for data storage to safeguard user information from potential threats such as data breaches, system failures, and cyberattacks.

The robust security features offered by AWS are expected to mitigate risks and ensure the safety of user data during adverse events.

However, the switch to US-based servers introduces complexities related to data jurisdiction and privacy.


Under the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act, enacted in 2018, US law enforcement agencies have the authority to compel companies like AWS to comply with data requests, even for information stored overseas.

This provision raises concerns that Upbit’s user data, including that of South Korean clients, could be accessible to US authorities, posing potential privacy issues for international users, especially those in regions with stringent data protection laws.

The change in Upbit’s data storage policy comes amid a surge in South Korea’s cryptocurrency market.

According to a recent Chainalysis report, the market has experienced substantial growth, influenced by the Korea Premium Index (KPI) — commonly known as the Kimchi Premium — which reflects the price disparity for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether between South Korean exchanges and global markets.


The report attributes this premium to high local demand and favorable market conditions, further fueling the rapid expansion of the country’s crypto ecosystem.

South Koreans Turn to Crypto
A recent survey has revealed that most young South Koreans are losing faith in the national pension system, with many stating they see crypto and stocks as a better alternative.

The study found that more than three-quarters of people aged 20-39 “don’t trust” state-issued pensions.

Over half of respondents who said they were making their own pension plans claimed they were building their retirement funds with stocks and crypto.

Interestingly, even election candidates themselves have exposure to cryptocurrencies, with approximately 7% of them owning digital assets, according to a report by Yonhap that analyzed their asset disclosures.

Just recently, it was reported that South Korea is set to introduce stricter regulations for token listing on exchanges, including the blocking of tokens that have been hacked.

Upbit, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has revealed plans to store user data on Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers located in the United States starting October 1.

In an announcement, the exchange said the decision, which comes as part of a change in its privacy policy, is intended to bolster service reliability and address privacy and regulatory considerations.

Upbit said it seeks to enhance the continuity, scalability, and security of its services by leveraging AWS’s globally recognized infrastructure.

Major Exchanges Adopt AWS for Data Storage
The move by Upbut comes as major exchanges like Coinbase have also adopted AWS for data storage to safeguard user information from potential threats such as data breaches, system failures, and cyberattacks.

The robust security features offered by AWS are expected to mitigate risks and ensure the safety of user data during adverse events.

TON Network DEXs See Explosive Growth in Addresses and Transactions
The decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem on The Open Network (TON) network has experienced a surge in activity, characterized by an increase in new addresses and transactions.

According to recent data from CryptoQuant and Joao Wedson, Founder and CEO of Alphractal, the number of new addresses on TON DEXs like STON.fi and DeDust has increased significantly, indicating that more users are discovering and adopting the network for their trading needs.

STON.fi Leads the Charge
STON.fi, a DEX on the TON network, has emerged as the clear frontrunner, capturing a commanding 90% of all DEX transactions. This dominance can be attributed to its user-friendly interface, robust security measures, and a wide range of supported trading pairs.


Notably, STON.fi saw a significant 15% increase in addresses between Sept. 1 (148.9k) and Sept. 23 (171.3k), showcasing the platform’s rapid user acquisition.

Growth Spreads Across TON DEXs
The growth isn’t limited to STON.fi. Other DEXs on the TON network are also experiencing healthy address growth. DeDust, for instance, saw a 14.9% increase in addresses over the same period, reaching 171.4k addresses on Sept. 23 from 149.1k on Sept. 1. While Megaton Finance’s growth is more modest (1.75% increase from 5.7k to 5.8k addresses), it still reflects the overall positive trend within the TON DEX ecosystem.


Comparing the current data with the data from April 9 – since that day TON DEXs started to experience continuous growth and user adoption – STON.fi and DeDust reached a 924% and 1053% increase in addresses, respectively, from a mere 14.8k.

TON’s Steady Growth in Daily Transactions
The TON network has also experienced a remarkable surge in daily transactions, particularly within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region. Total daily transactions skyrocketed from 319.4k on Jan. 27 to 11.4 million on Sept. 11, representing an impressive growth of 3,569,092%.

Furthermore, the total value locked (TVL) within the TON network has risen to $420.2 million as of Sept. 23, up over 3,000% from $13.5 million on Jan. 1.

Telegram Fuels TON Network Growth
One of the key factors driving the growth of the TON network has been its deep integration with the popular messaging app Telegram. Leveraging Telegram’s vast user base of nearly 950 million, the TON ecosystem effectively tapped into this audience through features like an official wallet embedded within the Telegram app and support for various bots and mini apps such as Notcoin, Catizen, and Hamster Kombat.

After the arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov on Aug. 24, the price of Toncoin, TON’s native cryptocurrency, dropped from $6.8 to $5.2 and reached its monthly low of $4.6 on Sept. 6. After that, the price of Toncoin recovered a bit and is currently at $5.5.

In response to Durov’s arrest, the TON Society, the network’s official community group, issued a statement on Aug. 27, calling it a “direct assault on a basic human right – the freedom of expression of everyone.”
The Ethereum price has struggled to make headway today, remaining at $2,644 as the market drops by 4% in 24 hours.

ETH is now up by a very healthy 15% in the past week, with a 4% loss in a month and 66% increase in the past year.

It’s likely that the next few weeks and months will bring further increases for the alt, with Coinglass data showing open interest in long Ethereum positions has increased substantially in recent days.

Investors seem to be betting that ETH will begin to test higher levels, with $3,000 being the next significant target on its horizon.

Ethereum Price Breakout – Open Interest Spike Points to $3,000 Target
What’s bullish about ETH’s chart right now is that its support (green) and resistance (red) levels indicate how it has been trading within a steadily climbing range.

And what we have seen this morning is the Ethereum price jump from its current support level, where it may begin a push towards its current resistance.

We’ve also seen ETH’s relative strength index (purple) rise from 40 this morning to just over 50, another sign of improving momentum.


It’s clear that a majority of traders believe that Ethereum’s general trend at the moment remains upward, with its average funding rate rising to 0.0076% today.

A positive funding rate means that more traders are going long on Ethereum than shorting it, as we saw in early August.

And in turn, this implies an expectation of a rising price, with $3,000 being the next big target for ETH.

It may take some time to reach this benchmark, however, given that Ethereum witnessed a net outflow last week among institutional investors.

Of course, the CoinGlass data above suggests that things are now turning, with the Fed’s rate cut last week serving as a catalyst for more optimism.

Ethereum remains one of the likeliest coins to benefit from an end-of-year surge, given its network’s sustained position as the largest layer-one platform in the sector.

It will also see the significant Pectra upgrade at some point in Q4 of this year or Q1 2025, bringing improved optimization and validation, among other things.

This will help secure its position in the face of increased competition from Solana, with ETH likely to remain very much in demand for some time to come.

The Ethereum price is likely to reach $3,000 by the end of October, before ending the year at around $3,500.

New High-Potential Altcoins for Quicker Gains
While ETH should comfortably reach $3,000 in the not-too-distant future, other coins may rise more dramatically in the coming weeks.

This includes smaller cap tokens and also presale coins, which can often rally hard after a successful raise.

While there are dozens of new presale coins around at the moment, one of the most notable is Memebet Token (MEMEBET).

Memebet Token is in the process of launching its own crypto-friendly casino, and has already raised $250,000 in its recently opened presale.


Memebet Token arguably boasts some of the strongest fundamentals of any new coin right now, with its gambling platform set to provide more than 1,000 crypto-native games once it launches.

This will include virtual slots and table games, as well a comprehensive sportsbook that will cover most major events.

Users will be able to place bets with established meme coins such as Pepe, Dogecoin, Bonk and Shiba Inu, yet they will be able to increase their rewards if they use MEMEBET.

As such, there will be a very strong incentive to hold MEMEBET, helping to boost demand for the coin, which will have a max supply of two billion.


Investors can join its sale by going to the official Memebet Token website, where 1 MEMEBET token costs $0.0253.

This price will rise numerous times before the sale ends, so buyers should act sooner rather than later.
Crypto exchange Kraken has acquired Coin Meester B.V. (BCM), one of the Netherlands’ oldest registered crypto broker firms.

The deal, finalized on Tuesday, marks a significant step in Kraken’s strategy to strengthen its footprint across Europe, the exchange said in a blog post.

By acquiring BCM, Kraken aims to solidify its presence in the Dutch market and further establish its position as a registered Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in key European countries, including France and Poland.

“The completion of the BCM acquisition is a key milestone in our European expansion, allowing us to leverage our strong footprint and market-leading position in euro volume and liquidity to significantly grow our market share,” said Brian Gahan, Kraken Managing Director Europe.

EU Gears Up for Implementation of MiCA
This move comes as the European crypto market gears up for the implementation of the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which is expected to introduce stricter regulatory standards across the region.

Over the past two years, Kraken has been actively expanding its operations across Europe.


The exchange now offers VASP services either directly or through partnerships in multiple countries, including Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, France, Poland, and the Netherlands.

“We are one of the few in Europe that can combine global scale with a compliant offering and a superior client experience,” Gahan added.


As the European crypto market remains fragmented, Kraken aims to leverage its global scale and comprehensive product offerings to capture a larger market share amid rising costs and increased competition.

In addition to its expansion efforts, Kraken has also bolstered its brand presence through strategic sports partnerships.

The exchange has become the Official Crypto and Web3 Partner for Tottenham Hotspur and Atlético de Madrid.

Starting in the 2024 season, Kraken’s logo will be featured as the Official Sleeve Partner on the jerseys of both clubs’ men’s and women’s teams.

Kraken Responds to SEC Allegations Amid Regulatory Scrutiny
Just recently, Kraken responded to allegations from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it violated federal securities laws.

The SEC claims that several digital assets offered by Kraken should be classified as unregistered securities.

In its defense, Kraken has denied these accusations, asserting that the assets in question do not meet the legal criteria to be considered securities.

Meanwhile, Kraken has recently faced a legal setback in Australia.

Last month, the Federal Court ruled against Bit Trade, a subsidiary of Kraken’s parent company, Payward Incorporated.

In its ruling, the court said the platform has breached the country’s Corporations Act section s994B(2) since October 2021.

In 2020, Kraken crypto exchange acquired Bit Trade to offer crypto offer digital asset services in Australia.
Over the past 24 hours, the XRP price has remained moderately unphased after some fluctuation, holding steady with a 0.08% gain.

Meanwhile, a technical pattern brewing since March 2020 is on the cusp of a breakout.

Indeed, this negligible movement is a step back from the Fed rate cut-fueled growth observed last week, with XRP retaining just a 0.53% gain since last Tuesday.

However, this may indicate that XRP has corrected and found its footing following significant volatility.

Although XRP may not be as hot right now, with its trading volume down another 3.17% to $909.3 million over the past 24 hours, stability may be what the altcoin needs before its next move.

4-Year Triangle Breakout Nearing: How Far Can XRP Price Rise?
A closer look at the XRP price chart reveals that technical indicators have become increasingly bullish, in favor of an upward breakout from the 4-year symmetrical triangle pattern.

XRP/USDT 1W chart, 4-year symmetrical triangle pattern. Source: Binance.
Most significantly, it seems that XRP has found comfort in its new bullish lean, as its Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains firm in its position above the neutral line, currently at 60.


Although this is neutral, it exhibits a strong bias towards buying pressure.

This sentiment is mirrored by the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which is gradually moving away from negative territory week on week.

It is now at -0.06, just half of what it was at the start of the month.

Meanwhile, as the MACD line maintains a comfortable lead above the Signal line, it seems that bulls are in control, making a breakout in the near term credible.

Despite this correction, XRP has decisively maintained its position above the 200EMA support after reclaiming it at $0.52, a strong demand zone since early July.

For the XRP price to continue its upward trajectory, the price must break the $0.60 level and reclaim the 200 SMA as support.

A clean break above these levels would signal the potential for a larger rally and a shift in market sentiment.

The extent of such a move could trigger a 225% rally in the coming months, reclaiming the past high of $1.97.

However, with fundamental catalysts stacking up for cryptocurrency space and Ripple honing in on the stablecoin and custody market, the potential for even further growth is considerable.

This Fleeting Opportunity Could Rally Twice As Hard
Although a $2 XRP is certainly an appealing prospect, emerging opportunities hold the potential for truly substantial gains.

Strategic investors may find an advantage in diversifying into newer low-cap meme coins that have the potential to rally exponentially.

The most prominent of which is a new Solana GameFi token Mega Dice ($DICE) the native token to the Mega Dice platform – a top brand in the crypto casino domain, boasting over 10,000 active players monthly and exceeding $50 million in monthly wagering.

The platform offers utilities such as casino cashback, airdrop rewards, and NFT perks for holders. Something that may be credited to its instant success, raising over $1.8 million in its presale so far.

But this opportunity is fleeting. With a launch date on the DEX Radium set for September 30th, there is a very real chance that once DICE hits exchanges, it may never be this low again.


The team looks to the success of Rollbit ($RLB) as a baseline. Given its superior feature set, $DICE buyers are confident that Rollbit’s peak 8,000% return for its early investors is more than achievable.

As the GameFi industry surges forward, crypto gambling emerges as one of its fastest-growing and most innovative subsectors, boasting an estimated market value of $250 million in 2023.

Shiba Shootout is a mobile game that combines the popular Shiba Inu meme with a playful Wild West theme.

In this gaming model, players can earn SHIBASHOOT tokens by playing games. Users engage in various combat scenarios and duels to defeat outlaws and become the best marksman.

Shiba Shootout invites gamers to join a community of gunslingers and creates a competitive environment. Its web3 app will be launched to introduce various decentralized features and facilitate more extensive interactions within its community.

SHIBASHOOT Powers the Ecosystem
SHIBASHOOT is the platform’s native token, and it is distributed across various aspects to ensure growth and overall development.

35% of the total supply, which amounts to 770,000,000 tokens, will be distributed in the ongoing presale. This will help early investors accumulate as many as they desire.

20% will also be used for marketing to ensure that words about Shiba Shootout continue to spread to potential users. Another 20% will go towards staking activities to reward those who lock in their funds for a specified period of time.


10% will go to project funds to cater to various developmental needs within the ecosystem, and 10% will go to liquidity to ensure easy buying and selling at the desired price for users.

5% will be allocated to the Rootin’ Tootin’ Shooter Fund.

SHIBASHOOT is not just another meme coin token without utility; it holds a unique position that distinguishes it from regular meme coins.

The token draws inspiration from the Wild West’s adventurous and competitive spirit while emphasizing gameplay and thoughtful engagement.

It encourages players to think critically rather than participate casually. The token supports events that foster interactions among participants, and there are structured plans to ensure its long-term practical use, sustainability, and utility.


Some Utility Ideas Within the Ecosystem
The token has diverse utility, providing users with different ways to earn and interact within the ecosystem.

Posse Rewards is a referral program that requires users to invite friends to the Shiba Showdown community.

When they do this, they can earn bonus tokens, and the referred friend can also earn bonus tokens. The more people referred to the platform, the greater the reward.

There are also regular Campfire Stories, which are sessions where community members discuss their experiences with crypto and meme coins in a casual storytelling format.

These activities increase the sense of community among members within the ecosystem and allow them to grow stronger and learn from one another.

Shiba Shootout users can also vote on crucial project decisions relating to token governance roundups. This is designed to mimic Wild West town citizenry participation.

This also allows users to be a part of the project’s growth, as the project’s future is expected to align with the desires of the majority of the community.

There is also a Lucky Lasso lottery system, in which participants can use Shiba Showdown tokens to win big crypto prizes. A portion of these prizes also goes to charitable initiatives.

In the same vein, users can also use the Savings Saddlebags feature to automatically allocate a percentage of their tokens to a dedicated wallet. This allows them to lock their tokens for a while for the opportunity to earn rewards in the form of extra tokens.

The platform also has a staking opportunity called Cactus Staking. This requires users to lock their tokens for a specified period of time. The longer they stake, the more tokens they accumulate as rewards.

These utility ideas could attract more people to the ecosystem, as investors are always on the lookout for rewarding experiences and tokens that can earn them some income.

Through the Posse Reward program, Lucky Lasso Lotteries, Cactus Staking, and Saving Saddle Bag, Shiba Shootout is promoting a community that is continuously engaged while also earning some income for their activities within the ecosystem.

Join the Presale Early
With the project promising to be interesting and rewarding, joining the presale early could be a good decision. At this presale stage, the price of one SHIBASHOOT token is $0.0203.


To purchase the token, the first step is to create a digital wallet. Then, visit the presale website to connect the wallet.

After this, you must exchange your preferred cryptocurrency for SHIBASHOOT tokens. Doing this will help you secure your share of the presale allocation.

Users can claim their tokens and rewards at the end of the presale period.

Bitcoin Mining Dominance Shifts to US as China's Bitcoin Hashrate Surges 55%
Despite China’s 2021 cryptocurrency ban, the country still maintains significant control over the Bitcoin mining network, with over 55% of the global hashrate.

However, as Bitcoin mining grows in institutional legitimacy, particularly in the U.S., American mining firms are quickly closing the gap.

The U.S. now controls 40% of the global hashrate because of a fundamental shift in mining dynamics as political, regulatory, and economic pressures impact the two countries differently.

China’s Bitcoin Mining: Massive Growth Amid Ban
According to Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, Chinese mining pools still control 55% of the global Bitcoin mining network. This revelation is startling, given China’s aggressive anti-crypto measures in recent years.


However, Chinese miners have found ways to continue operating, even in the face of government crackdowns.


Before the 2021 ban, China dominated Bitcoin mining, contributing more than 75% of the global hashrate at one point.

At the time, the Chinese government framed the ban as necessary to maintain financial stability and prevent illegal activity.

As a result, many miners were forced to shut down operations, and some relocated to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions like the U.S. and Kazakhstan.

However, Chinese miners have shown remarkable resilience. They have adapted by using smaller, more covert operations to avoid detection, allowing them to maintain a substantial share of the global hashrate.

China’s stance on cryptocurrency regulations could change further as the country plans to amend its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations in 2025.

These amendments are expected to cover cryptocurrency transactions, aiming to curtail illegal activities associated with digital assets.

U.S. Bitcoin Mining Firms on the Rise
While China still holds most of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate, the U.S. controls 40% of the global mining activity.

The growth of Bitcoin mining in the U.S. has been driven by institutional investment and a favorable regulatory environment.

Institutional interest in Bitcoin mining has surged in the U.S. as major investors and firms seek to capitalize on the sector’s profitability and operational leniency compared to China.

This trend is further supported by the involvement of key political figures, such as former President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the crypto-mining industry.

In June 2024, Trump met with mining executives in Florida and promised that his administration would ensure the industry’s fair treatment if re-elected.

Even as the U.S. gains more dominance in Bitcoin mining, global miners face significant challenges, particularly regarding profitability.

Bitcoin mining revenue dropped significantly in August 2024, marking the lowest monthly revenue in a year.

Total miner revenue reached $827.56 million in August, down more than 10.5% from July’s $927.35 million. Despite the decline, revenue was still up 5% compared to the same period in 2023.

This revenue also decreased because of the instability and volatility in Bitcoin prices, which hovered around $56,000 throughout August with much market panic.

The combination of fluctuating Bitcoin prices and decreasing mining yields has created an environment where miners are under growing financial pressure, even as demand for Bitcoin remains high.

Miners globally are feeling the squeeze, but the shift in hashrate from China to the U.S. has allowed American mining firms to expand their operations and take advantage of cheaper electricity and more favorable regulatory conditions.

Missed out on Pepe? Here’s another chance.

Popo is the new frog coin in town. The blue poison dart frog is rallying crypto investors for redemption.

The mission has resonated with the audience. The Popo ($FROP) presale is rapidly approaching the $1.5 million milestone.

Pepe Fails to Inspire, Investors Turn to Popo
Pepe’s rise to become the third-largest meme coin was astonishing. Although the meme coin has been on a lackluster journey over the last few weeks, the lifetime ROI of Pepe still stands at an impressive 14,000%.

It is wildly optimistic to expect Pepe to replicate its past performance. With its market cap already at over $3 billion, Pepe has limited room for growth. The recent price corrections strengthen the opinion that Pepe might be saturated.

Over the last 30 days, Pepe has only gained 5%. It is difficult for latecomers to capitalize on the meme coin’s growth.


There is no point in holding Pepe in the hope of making multifold gains. But promising new meme coins like Popo could deliver that.


Clever Branding, Multichain Infrastructure
Popo taps into the cultural relevance and community strength of Pepe using its clever branding.

“Once a tribal warrior, Popo’s resolve is fueled by Pepe’s abandonment of their tribe in the face of peril. Left with nothing but a burning desire for retribution, Popo retreats into exile, determined to orchestrate Pepe’s downfall and rallying allies to his cause.”

At the same time, it has a lower initial market cap than Pepe. That gives it more space for growth and expansion.


Those who join the presale, in particular, benefit from attractive entry points. The heavily discounted presale price and staking APYs maximize the growth potential, while minimizing the risk.

As a multichain token, $FROP will be available across eight major blockchains––BNB (main chain), Solana, Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. The multichain infrastructure ensures a wide network of support and accessibility.

For anyone who recalls Pepe’s action-packed journey with regret, Popo is an excellent crypto to consider now.

A Fully Audited Meme Coin
Establishing credibility early is critical to the healthy growth of a meme coin.

Popo has prioritized security and transparency to relieve investors of any concerns about its technical aspects. The focus on credibility has helped fuel traffic to the presale. Popo is rapidly approaching the $1.5 million milestone.


Popo has undergone a security audit by SolidProof, completed KYC verification on Pinksale, and published its smart contract for public review. These steps reassure early investors of the project’s reliability.

Community Engagement is a Priority
The Popo tokenomics emphasizes community engagement.

25% of the total supply is reserved for presale investors.
25% for staking.
25% for marketing.
15% of the token supply is dedicated to community rewards.
The remaining 11% will maintain liquidity on exchanges.
Top influencers from both the Web2 and Web3 markets will lead the charge to form the #popoarmy. The influential force is set to bring more attention and growth to the project.


Alongside staking rewards, Popo will introduce airdrops and other incentive programs to encourage continued participation from the community.

To maintain a healthy token economy, the project will employ a burn mechanism. It ensures scarcity by reducing the overall supply of $FROP over time. All unsold tokens from the presale will be burned. That could potentially drive up the token’s value as demand increases.

Join the Popo community on X (Twitter) and Telegram for the latest presale updates.

Can Popo Overthrow Pepe?
Pepe is unlikely to outperform Pepe in market cap this year. Pepe’s current market cap makes it difficult for Popo to catch up in just a few months.

But if the exchange launch is a success, it has the potential to deliver impressive returns. The low entry points through the discounted presale prices create an attractive opportunity for early backers.

The project’s growing momentum, coupled with its engaging narrative and strong community, makes it a top meme coin to watch this season.

$FROP Launches on September 30th
The debut launch of $FROP on crypto exchanges is scheduled for September 30th. There is limited time to secure the tokens at presale prices.

Popo has confirmed upcoming listings on centralized exchanges, a move that will boost its visibility and liquidity.

If the presale progress is any sign, the residual FOMO from the presale is expected to skyrocket $FROP once it hits exchanges.

Using a compatible wallet and cryptocurrencies, anyone can join the presale in just a few steps. The presale also supports fiat purchases.
As historical, technical, and fundamental factors ring bullish, analysts believe the groundwork has been laid for an impending altseason, with some citing its potential to be the “biggest bull run for altcoins since 2017.”

In a September 23rd X post, pseudonymous analyst Moustache observed that TOTAL2, the altcoins’ total market cap excluding Bitcoin, was in the process of breaking out of a descending broadening wedge that has been in play for the past six months.

Moustache explained that the optimistic outlook for altcoins is supported by the RSI breaking out of its downward trend fuelled by recent buying pressure, leading to an impending bullish cross from the moving average convergence divergence indicator (MACD).

He further emphasized that this setup could lead to “a god candle like we haven’t seen for years,” signaling a significant bullish movement in the altcoin market.


With this recent buying pressure, Bitcoin’s dominance has lapsed to 57.48%, down 0.71% over the past week, according to TradingView data.


Analysts have interpreted this sharp decline as a sign that Bitcoin’s dominance is peaking. Investors appear to be selling BTC and rotating their capital into alternative coins, indicating that “altcoins are likely the focus for now.”

The Perfect Storm: Fundamental Catalysts Favour an Altseason
While technical indicators suggest an impending breakout, it is the fundamental catalysts that will sustain a more prolonged altseason. Pseudonymous analyst Tracer outlined this perspective in a September 23rd X thread, highlighting several key factors.

Most notably, the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points has fostered a more risk-on attitude among investors, leading them to venture into more speculative investments like cryptocurrency as the cost of borrowing lowers.

Tracer also pointed out the anticipated release of $16 billion from FTX creditors between December 2024 and March 2025, which is expected to inject more capital into the market.

Recent 10x Research reports echo this sentiment, estimating that between $5 billion and $8 billion could re-enter the crypto space, further propelling Bitcoin and Altcoin’s ascent.

Political developments have also significantly bolstered sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with the upcoming US election emerging as a major catalyst for optimism.

Vice President Kamala Harris’s first public endorsement of digital assets has heightened this bullish outlook. In her recent comments, she affirmed a commitment to supporting crypto and AI to foster innovation.

This endorsement, along with Donald Trump’s open support for cryptocurrency, highlights a growing bipartisan backing that is expected to drive significant momentum in the cryptocurrency space as the push for regulatory clarity intensifies. Tracer summarised:

Everything points to an imminent rise and altseason.

Altcoin Season Isn’t Here Yet, According to Metrics
With this building bullish narrative surrounding altseason, analysts like Tracer forecast a kick-off as soon as 9 days away.

However, it’s not yet time to celebrate, as the altcoin season index by Blockchain Center indicates that “it is not altcoin season.”

According to this index, 75% of the top 50 coins need to outperform Bitcoin over the last season (90 days) for a technical altseason.

Currently, the index shows that just 33% of the leading 50 altcoins have outperformed, a slight step back from its sharp rise to 46% last week.

Therefore, while optimism is high and catalysts are aligning, caution remains as the market waits for a more decisive shift in altcoin performance.

Meanwhile, we remain in an accumulation zone as we approach this critical juncture, presenting a valuable opportunity for investors to reaffirm their positions on the most promising altcoins leading into altseason.

In response to the rising demand for Islamic finance solutions, Bybit launched its Islamic Account on September 24, 2024, offering Shariah-compliant crypto trading for Muslim traders across the world.

This new offering from Bybit includes spot trading for 75 selected cryptocurrencies, along with trading bots such as DCA and Spot Grid Bot.

New Crypto Account Targeting Muslim Community
Bybit’s Islamic Account is certified by ZICO Shariah and CryptoHalal, which confirms that all trading products comply with Islamic finance standards and Shariah law.


Muslim traders can now access a crypto account that fully aligns with their religious beliefs, globally except for regions with legal restrictions.

The release stated that Bybit’s introduction of the Islamic Account would address a growing demand in the $2.3 trillion Islamic finance sector, offering Shariah-compliant crypto trading options that cater specifically to the financial needs of Muslim traders worldwide.


“We are thrilled to introduce our Islamic Account, which represents a major milestone in our commitment to providing inclusive and accessible trading solutions,” said Bybit Sales & Marketing Director Joan Han.

“By partnering with Crypto Halal and ZICO Holdings, we have ensured that our offerings align with the principles of Islamic finance, empowering Muslim traders to participate in the growing cryptocurrency market,” said Han.

Bybit Receives Provisional Approval from VARA
Bybit recently received provisional approval from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), moving closer to a full Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license.


This development will enable the exchange to offer its services to more investors in the region once fully operational.

Bybit established its global headquarters in Dubai in 2022 and has been working to expand its presence in the city’s growing crypto sector.

Flockerz (FLOCK) is a meme coin community keen on community involvement and decentralization through its vote-to-earn mechanism.

Its cryptocurrency, FLOCK, is created as a community-driven cryptocurrency that empowers its holders to participate in governance decisions. This makes it a democratic alternative to many crypto projects.

This feature also gives users the opportunity to actively shape the future of the project since they have a say in how it grows. They also directly benefit from their involvement.

Centralized projects usually rely on a single entity for decision-making; however, Flockerz is empowering its community, regarded as ‘The Flock’, to collectively participate in its decentralized ecosystem. This makes every user a vital part of the crypto project’s direction.

Flocktopia is the heart of the project. The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform creates a sense of ownership among community members and encourages them to see the essence of their investment in the project’s success.

Earn from the Presale Through the Flockerz Nest Presale
Flockerz allows its users to earn from the presale period through its Flockers Nest Presale.


This program is designed to benefit those who invest early. Participants can buy and stake their tokens with the opportunity to earn substantial rewards.

Stakers can enjoy an annual percentage yield (APY) over a 2-year staking period. With this setup, they will be able to benefit from passive rewards and get incentives as they hold their tokens while also participating in various voting processes.

In other words, users can lock in their tokens and earn passive rewards while actively influencing the project with their voting activities.

Earn By Participating in the Future of the Project
Major decisions that affect the token are not made by insiders but organically by the community. The more users participate in the future of the project, the more FLOCK tokens they earn.

Users will continue to earn whether they cast their votes on the latest proposal or help to shape the next big move on the platform.

It is a project without a central authority, and it will be rewarding every vote and move that takes the community forward with the FLOCK token.

Flockerz Structured Roadmap
Flockerz has outlined a strategic flight plan to ensure its growth and sustainability:

Step 1: Security and Presale
The project began with a Nest Security Audit to verify the safety of the FLOCK contract. Following this, the presale was launched, inviting early investors to join the community.

The presale seeks to bring in many users to form a strong foundation for future growth.

The project also launched a worldwide marketing campaign with the aim of making FLOCK popular and ensuring a powerful flight.

Step 2: Community Growth
Various strategies are to be carried out to ensure that word about Flockerz continues to spread. The project will involve influential voices who can amplify the marketing process and attract a larger and more enthusiastic flock.

The aim is to make FLOCK take over the Ethereum ecosystem and become the talk of many people.

Step 3: Market Launch
After building momentum, FLOCK will be listed on global exchanges, allowing for public trading. This is expected to give it even more visibility since it will be more accessible to people on various centralized and decentralized exchanges.

The project will not relent in its marketing activities as it plans to keep expanding its kingdom. The plan is to take the “crypto world by storm”.

It will also get its users involved in the community process as it introduces the vote-to-earn system. This process will also reward flockers for their participation and wisdom.


Flockerz Token Distribution
The FLOCK tokens are allocated to various areas of the project to meet different needs:

20% for Early Bird Catch: Reserved for early presale participants, rewarding their early commitment.
25% for Token Breeding: Allocated for staking, allowing loyal holders to earn additional rewards.
25% for Flock Vault: A treasury for collective resource allocation, incentivizing community voting.
10% for Exchanges Fuel: Set aside to facilitate trading operations on various platforms.
20% for Bird Calls: Dedicated to marketing efforts, ensuring widespread awareness of FLOCK.
Join the Presale to Start Earning
To join the community, connect your MetaMask wallet (if you are using a desktop) or Trust Wallet (on your mobile device) to the website.

After that, you will be able to buy FLOCK tokens with crypto options like ETH, BNB, and USDT. There is also an option to use your bank card.

You must have topped up your wallet with the required funds to load up the number of FLOCK tokens you want to buy. Make sure you have a little left to cover gas fees.

After that, you can click on the buy widget and swap your token for FLOCK. Don’t forget that staking your funds immediately will earn you extra funds in the presale.

Solana's Mega Dice casino is about to wrap up its $DICE presale after a $2 million raise.

Why Trust Cryptonews


Solana’s hottest new GambleFi token, Mega Dice ($DICE) has raked in almost $1.9 million so far in an ongoing presale that will end in five days.

Crypto experts are lauding Mega Dice as a brilliant new token offering from what an online brand that is already a well-established name in GambleFi.

Mega Dice launched last year as the world’s first licensed crypto casino accessible through the popular messaging app Telegram and has since attracted 50,000 players.

Others have since followed suit and launched iGaming bots on Telegram, most notably TG Casino.

Mega Dice’s website currently offers gamers over 4,500 ways to win money, including classic staples like slots, roulette and blackjack, in addition to a comprehensive bookmaker that streams the most popular games from a selection of over 50 sports and esports.

The bookmaker currently collects average monthly wagers totaling $50 million between some 10,000 monthly active users.


The ICO for Mega Dice’s new Solana token $DICE turbocharges the online casino’s services to a whole new level. As the platform’s native token, players can use $DICE to fund games and receive payment, with some games requiring the token.

Let’s see why investors pumped nearly $2 million into GambleFi’s hottest ICO.


Solana’s Mega $DICE: GambleFi Utility In Spades
$DICE has a hard supply cap of 420 million tokens, with 35% allocated to the presale, where the token sells at a current fixed price of $0.116056 per coin. This is a guaranteed fixed price, so if the token does well on the open market, there is a chance it could never be this cheap again.

Given the fact that million dollar presales are rare, this $2 million ICO bodes well for Mega Dice’s potential appreciation.

$DICE holders don’t necessarily need to risk their tokens at the casino to get rewards. They can stake them to earn passive income, with 10% of the total supply earmarked by the casino for staking rewards.

$DICE is integrated into the Solana-based casino’s loyalty program, offering more generous rewards to gamers who play with the native token. Mega Dice is the only GambleFi coin that distributes a share of profits to its users on a daily basis through its novel staking system.

It also unlocks access to exclusive competitions and VIP experiences.


Then there’s also the casino’s buyback and burn program, which reduces the supply, increasing scarcity and potentially pumping value.

In sum, $DICE is on a roll. The Mega Dice token offering is a brand new GambleFi token in a fast-growing sector, backed by a well-established brand, transparent tokenomics, strong fundamentals, and utility beyond gaming.

Given the multiple ways investors can put their DICE to work, it’s obvious why GambleFi investors are stacking Mega Dice.
In a keynote speech delivered at the Barron’s Advisor 100 Summit on September 20, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan revealed that top financial advisors are increasingly incorporating cryptocurrency into their personal portfolios.

Increase in Financial Advisors Embracing Crypto Signals Changing Times
In a memo published on September 23, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan reflected on his keynote speech.


Hougan, making his third consecutive appearance, assessed the audience’s familiarity with cryptocurrency.

In prior years, only 10% to 20% of attendees reported holding crypto in their portfolios, a figure that remained steady last year.

However, this year saw a substantial change, with approximately 70% of attendees confirming they hold Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies


While this personal adoption of crypto shows promise, Hougan pointed out that many financial advisors are still hesitant to recommend or include these assets in their clients’ investment strategies.

This hesitation stems from restrictions imposed by broker-dealers. Most firms do not yet allow advisors to offer Bitcoin ETFs or other crypto-related products to their clients, with Morgan Stanley being a notable exception, permitting its advisors to present Bitcoin ETFs to their clients.

Hougan highlighted a critical juncture for financial advisors, where growing personal interest in crypto meets institutional resistance.

As more advisors embrace crypto in their own portfolios, the pressure for broker-dealers to support these products in client portfolios will likely intensify.

This signals the potential for digital assets to become an integral part of mainstream financial planning in the future.

Bitwise CIO Believes Several Positive Signs Are Driving Crypto Adoption
The Bitwise CIO memo also detailed a growing interest, alongside several positive signs in the cryptocurrency market, such as the Federal Reserve’s first interest rate cut in four years and the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by major financial firms.


The Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut suggests a more favorable economic outlook, prompting investors to consider alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies.

However, Hougan argued that the most significant indicator of change is the increasing number of advisors holding Bitcoin in their personal portfolios.

By personally investing in crypto, advisors are becoming more comfortable with the asset, gradually overcoming their initial fears and doubts.

As interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rises, it’s likely that more financial advisors will start recommending these assets to their clients.
Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, faces sentencing in the United States Southern District of New York on September 24 for her role in the FTX collapse, as shown in court documents.

The once prominent figure in the crypto industry will appear before Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan federal courthouse at 3 p.m. EST.

Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison Faces The Music
In December 2022, Ellison admitted guilt to charges of wire fraud, money laundering, and both securities and commodities fraud.

As the ex-girlfriend of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Ellison faces a potential total of 110 years in prison for her crimes, although there is a possibility she may avoid prison time altogether.


Ellison accepted a cooperation deal with federal prosecutors that saw her take the stand against Bankman-Fried for a whirlwind three days of testimony where she painted the one-time “king of crypto” as an image-conscious and power-hungry digital finance tycoon.


Bankman-Fried, for his part, attempted to discredit Ellison as a witness by releasing pages of her personal diary to The New York Times ahead of his trial; the move landed him behind bars after Kaplan found probable cause that he was guilty of witness tampering in August 2023.

Bankman-Fried was ultimately sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture this past March, a victory the U.S. government partly finds Ellison’s assistance responsible for.

“The ‘what’ and ‘how’ of the crimes, as well as the ‘why,’ would have been difficult to prove without Ellison’s testimony,” federal prosecutors wrote in a September 17 letter to Kaplan recommending leniency for Ellison.

“The government cannot think of another cooperating witness in recent history who has received a greater level of attention and harassment,” the U.S. government letter continues. “The attendant professional consequences of this level of notoriety are obvious and unlikely to be short lived.”

Executives Responsible For FTX Collapse See Potential Jail Time
Ellison is not the only SBF associate to face legal consequences lately for participating in the massive digital asset scandal as of late.

Ryan Salame, former CEO of FTX Digital Markets, pled guilty to criminal charges stemming from his time at the doomed crypto exchange in May 2024.

The crypto executive recently attempted to rescind his original plea after he accused prosecutors of failing to stop investigating his partner, Michelle Bond, on campaign finance violations.

Bond has since been indicted, while Salame faces potential sanctions for seemingly lying under oath.
An early Bitcoin miner from 2009 has resumed activity after ten years of dormancy, transferring 15 BTC to Kraken in recent weeks.

Key Transfers to Kraken
On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence shows that this Bitcoin whale started moving assets to Kraken three weeks ago. The wallet holds Bitcoin mined just a month after the network’s launch in January 2009, when Bitcoin’s anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was active.


The whale sent 10 BTC to Kraken in three separate transactions about three weeks ago. On Tuesday, an additional 5 BTC, valued at over $300,000, was transferred. Before these activities, the wallet had been inactive since 2014.

Between 2011 and 2014, the owner initiated several transactions, transferring Bitcoin to other wallets and exchanges. The 10-year transaction hiatus intrigued many observers, especially considering the increase in the value of its Bitcoin holdings—from $474,000 to over $80 million.

This is not the first time Bitcoin wallets will become reactivated after many years of dormancy.


Last week, five Satoshi-era wallets moved $16 million worth of Bitcoin after 15 years of inactivity.

In June, another Bitcoin wallet that had been dormant for 14 years transferred 50 BTC to Binance. The wallet was believed to belong to a miner who received the BTC as a mining reward in 2010.

The movement of early Bitcoin continues to fascinate market participants, as it affects liquidity and signals the long-term faith of early adopters in the asset.

While some may view these transfers as a sign of a potential sell-off, others see it as a confirmation of Bitcoin’s value after over a decade.

Speculation on Future Market Trends
The recent uptick in activity from Satoshi-era wallets comes as the crypto market shows signs of a potential bull run.

The Fear and Greed Index, a measure of market sentiment, is around the “neutral” zone, indicating a balance between fear and confidence among traders.

Additionally, Bitcoin ETFs have risen by $284 million in inflows, according to a recent report by CoinShares, signaling growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency.


Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to lower interest rates by 50 basis points. A rate cut will inject liquidity into the economy and fuel demand for risk assets like Bitcoin.

The timing of these Satoshi-era wallet movements, coupled with positive market indicators, has raised suggestions that early miners may be looking to capitalize on an upcoming price surge.

Circle, the issuer of the USDC and EURC stablecoins, has launched Compliance Engine, a new platform designed to simplify regulatory compliance for businesses using its programmable wallet platform.

Compliance Engine offers customizable, automated compliance checks, streamlining the process for businesses operating in the digital asset space. The platform is natively integrated into Circle’s infrastructure, eliminating the need for separate third-party integrations.


Customizable Compliance Checks
According to the Circle’s post from Sept. 24, the initial beta release focuses on the “Transaction Screening” feature, allowing real-time checks to identify potentially suspicious activity.

Businesses can customize rules based on risk type or severity and receive real-time reporting through a dashboard or webhooks.

Additional features like “Transaction Monitoring” and “Travel Rule” will be implemented in the coming months.


Transaction Monitoring will allow for periodic reviews of historical transactions to identify potential patterns of high-risk behavior when analyzing entities, such as users and wallets, holistically.

The Travel Rule feature will enable secure transmission of personally identifiable information (PII) for transactions between Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) and support verifications for self-hosted wallets.

Businesses can also granularly customize transaction and alert policies using Compliance Engine to align with their specific business needs and regulatory requirements.

The platform also supports incoming and outgoing transactions that are performed using programmable wallets. This includes EOA and MSCA wallet account types and developer-controlled or user-controlled wallets.

Compliance Engine supports a wide range of blockchains, including those supported by programmable wallets such as Avalanche (AVAX), Ethereum (ETH), Polygon PoS (MATIC), and Solana (SOL).

Circle’s USDC Transforms Humanitarian Aid
Besides international businesses, stablecoins can also be used for global financial inclusion and humanitarian aid.

According to the Circle’s Impact Report 2024, traditional financial systems often leave billions of people unbanked and hinder efficient humanitarian aid distribution due to slowness, high costs, and lack of accessibility.

“Global finance is now beginning to build solutions for a world where billions of people can access portable bank branches in the palms of their hands,” the report says.

“Today mobile money is an $800 billion market in sub-Saharan Africa, and online “neobanks” have amassed hundreds of millions of users in Latin America – many of whom had previously been unbanked.”
To address these challenges, Circle seeks to offer faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border transactions. The report showcases several examples of how USDC is making a positive impact.

In December 2022, UNHCR and Circle partnered to launch a humanitarian cash program that provided borderless digital U.S. dollars – USDC – to Ukrainians displaced by the war. These USDCs were transferred directly to recipients’ digital wallets via the Stellar (XLM) blockchain, allowing for almost instant access using a smartphone. The program included fully integrated cash-out options and adhered to all necessary regulations.

Circle allows recipients to convert their digital aid into cash or transfer it to their local bank accounts.

Rahat, a Nepal-based organization, uses USDC and smart contracts to provide financial aid directly to mobile phones before climate disasters.

WiiQare, a Congo-based startup, enables faster and more affordable cross-border healthcare payments for migrants using USDC.

Kura, a U.S.-Haitian company, reduces remittance costs and facilitates real-world spending for beneficiaries with USDC.

In the report, Circle also highlights USDC’s strengths, including price stability, transparency, regulation, and an open ecosystem, and paints a positive outlook of how stablecoins can address financial inequality and empower individuals and organizations worldwide.

While Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below its 200DMA at $64,000, other sectors of the crypto market are pumping, with investors scouring altcoin markets for the best crypto to buy now.

Bitcoin was last down just under 1.0% in the past 24 hours at $63,000, according to CoinMarketCap.

Best Crypto to Buy Now September 24 
Ethereum (ETH), meanwhile, was down 2.4%, or nearly $2,600, over the same time period as investors fretted about continued Ethereum ETF outflows.


However, altcoins are generally still performing well amid anticipation that global central bank easing will drive demand for riskier assets in the long run.

China just reduced its reserve requirement on banks by 50bps.


That comes one week after the Fed cut interest rates by 50bps, initiating the first cutting cycle since 2020.


US Core PCE inflation data out later this week could fuel the idea of Fed easing further if they show inflation falling back to the Fed’s 2.0% goal faster than anticipated.

That could help push Bitcoin back above $64,000 and open the door to run towards $70,000.

That could inject further momentum into the altcoin market, which has been heating up over the past week.

Some are even going as far as to bet that a new altcoin season is incoming.


Here are some strong-performing altcoins on Tuesday that might be the best crypto to buy now.

Best Crypto to Buy Now – Which Are They?
Dogwifhat (WIF)
According to TradingView, the Solana meme coin dogfight (WIF) was a leading performer on Tuesday, up over 10% on the day.

WIF will likely soon retest the downtrend that has been in play since April.

A break above here could spark a rapid 2.5x move back to yearly highs near $5.0.

Best Crypto to Buy Now September 24 
As a leading Solana meme coin, WIF stands to be a major beneficiary of any future altcoin season.

For investors looking to add exposure to meme coins, WIF is a strong candidate for the best crypto to buy now.

Alternatively, investors interested in meme coins might want to check out Cryptonews.com’s list of their favorite meme coin presales right now.

19 Best New Meme Coins

Meme coins like dogwifhat have a lot of upside potential, maybe as much as 10x.

However, traders looking for 50-100x upside potential will need to find smaller, lesser-known meme coins and get in before they start trending.

Meme coin presales are a great way to do this.

Conflux (CFX)
Another top performer and candidate for best crypto to buy now is Conflux (CFX).

Last, at $0.16, the innovative layer-1 blockchain recently pushed convincingly above its 50DMA.

Promising breakouts above the 50DMA have ultimately failed in recent months.

Best Crypto to Buy Now September 24 
But this time, things look different, with CFX potentially poised for a swift move back up to its March highs of $0.55.

Celestia (TIA)
For short-term traders, Celestia (TIA) is a good option.

TIA recently snapped a short-term downtrend and subsequently went on to confirm the breakout.

Last at $6.15, it could soon retest resistance at $7.60.

Best Crypto to Buy Now September 24 
Bulls will be hoping for a swift rally of more than 3x back to February highs above $20.
Due to increasing institutional adoption and benevolent Federal Reserve policies, the price of bitcoin has remained steady at around $64,000.

With key players like BlackRock positioning Bitcoin as a modern asset and looming regulatory clarity post-U.S. elections, investor confidence is building.

Market fundamentals and institutional support, combined with increased transparency measures like Chainlink’s proof of reserve, favour Bitcoin’s upward trajectory.

Four Fresh Reasons Why Bitcoin’s Price Will Continue to Surge, Says Michael Saylor
Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, predicts that Bitcoin’s price will keep rising due to four key factors. First, major firms like BlackRock position Bitcoin as “digital gold,” educating investors on its store-of-value potential with a modern technological twist.

Second, the Federal Reserve’s loose monetary policies make Bitcoin an attractive hedge against inflation. Third, institutional players such as BNY Mellon may soon offer Bitcoin custody services, simplifying investor access.


Finally, Saylor points to BlackRock’s approved Bitcoin ETF ladder, anticipating clearer regulatory guidance following the U.S. presidential election.


These factors strengthen institutional adoption and boost investor confidence in Bitcoin’s future growth.

21.co Enhances Transparency With Chainlink Proof of Reserve
21.co, the parent company of 21Shares, is integrating Chainlink’s proof of reserve technology into its Bitcoin wrapper, 21BTC.

This ensures that all 21BTC tokens issued on Ethereum and Solana are fully backed by real Bitcoin, verified in real-time.


Chainlink’s system automatically updates financial data on the blockchain, boosting transparency and confidence.

The move follows concerns about Coinbase Wrapped BTC (cbBTC) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), where doubts about sufficient reserves arose.

By incorporating proof of reserve, 21.co aims to reinforce trust in Bitcoin wrappers, which may attract more investors and contribute to upward momentum in BTC prices.

Political Momentum Boosts Bitcoin as Campaigns Embrace Crypto
As political campaigns heat up, Bitcoin is gaining traction among key figures like Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.

Historically, Bitcoin prices have surged during election seasons, with “Uptober” marking a period of strong bullish activity.


This trend mirrors the early days of the dot-com boom, as institutional players like BlackRock continue to introduce accessible Bitcoin investment products like ETFs.

With increasing political and institutional support, Bitcoin is moving into mainstream acceptance. As the November elections approach, market fundamentals are strengthening, suggesting that a post-election Bitcoin rally may follow.

Bitcoin Price Outlook: Support and Resistance Levels
Bitcoin is showing resilience around the $63,875 level, holding above the critical pivot of $63,110. The market is gradually recovering from recent dips, driven by increasing investor confidence.

The price action is navigating through a tight consolidation zone, with the $63,875 price as a focal point for buyers.

The 50-period EMA ($63,072) offers solid dynamic support, reinforcing Bitcoin’s upward trend.


Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview
On the upside, immediate resistance lies at $64,400. Should buyers push beyond this threshold, the next key resistance levels are $65,300 and $66,060.

Bitcoin’s recent steady ascent above the ascending trendline suggests the market is positioning itself for further gains contingent on surpassing these resistances. On the downside, immediate support is seen at $63,072, followed by $62,600 and $62,379.

The RSI is at 52, signifying neutral momentum but leaning slightly toward bullishness. Should it break above the 60 mark, it would signal stronger upward momentum. The 50-period EMA holds firm at $63,072, offering crucial support for the ongoing bullish narrative as long as prices remain above it.

Conclusion:
Bitcoin is stabilizing and maintaining support near $63,875. A breakout above $64,419 would be bullish, while a breach below $63,072 could signal short-term weakness.

Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is reportedly sharing a jail unit with Sean Combs (better known as Diddy) at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn after his arrest last week for sex trafficking, transportation for prostitution, and racketeering.

Metropolitan Detention Center’s Violent History
Speaking to three sources familiar with the matter, the report alleges that Bankman-Fried and Combs are being held in a “barrack-style area” that houses no more than twenty inmates who may require “special detention” due to their high-profile status.


Combs, who was denied bail last week after pleading innocent to the charges brought against him, may have reason to worry given the prison’s long history of violence and lackluster conditions.

According to U.S. District Judge Gary R. Brown, MDC inmates have regularly dealt with delayed medical care, aging infrastructure, and “frequent lockdowns due to violence.”

Legal counsel for Combs is currently seeking to remove rapper-turned-business mogul from the squalor MDC as he awaits his trial on criminal charges that could see him face life behind bars.


Bankman-Fried, meanwhile, is serving a 25-year sentence for ringleading a massive digital finance scheme that saw $8 billion worth of investor funds spent on luxury real estate, venture capital, and political donations.

The notoriously vegan A-list crypto convict has notably complained about the food quality at MDC, surviving largely on a diet of bread, water, and peanut butter.

In the spring, SBF told media outlet Puck that he had begun buying and trading beans and bags of rice from the prison’s commissary.

However, he recently refused a prison transfer that would most likely have seen him behind bars in his home state of California. He opted instead to stay in New York to be closer to his legal team as they fleshed out his appeal.

New Cellmates For Sam Bankman-Fried & Sean Combs?
SBF and Diddy join a long line of hated American public figures who have been housed behind the federal prison’s walls, including predatory rapper R. Kelly and Jefferey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.

New York’s only other federal prison, Metropolitan Correctional Center, was shuttered by the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 2021 following Epstein’s headline-making suicide.

With several sentencings still ahead for former FTX executives, it may be only a matter of time before Diddy and his cryptocurrency counterpart welcome some new cellmates.
With Bitcoin (BTC) looking perky above $64,000 and eyeing a possible break above its 200DMA that could open the door to a move to $70,000, traders are looking to position themselves in top crypto gainers today in the DEX markets that might be able to deliver fast gains.

Top Crypto Gainers Today
Risk appetite across cryptocurrency markets has been picking up in recent sessions as traders anticipate a Fed-led global central bank easing cycle.

China lowered its bank reserve requirements by 50bps on Tuesday, which added 1 trillion yen to Chinese financial markets.


US Core PCE inflation data on Friday could add fresh impetus to the recent market rally if they show US inflation falling faster than the Fed anticipated.

A new altcoin/meme coin season could be around the corner.


And while many major altcoins might be set up for 3-5x gains if Bitcoin breaks out towards $100,000, the biggest gains will be seen in the DEX markets.

In DEX markets, new tokens routinely post 10-20x gains in a single day.

Traders often turn to tools such as DEXScreener to find trading tokens.

Here are some top crypto gainers they will be monitoring today.

Top Crypto Gainers Today – Which Are They?
An Ethereum meme coin called Terminus (TERMINUS) has rallied 438% in the past 24 hours, per DEXScreener, reaching a market cap of $6.8 million.

Top Crypto Gainers Today
The token’s DEXScreener page doesn’t link to official social media pages or websites.

So, the purpose and idea of the token aren’t clear.

It also has two issues relating to its smart contract, per a Go+ Security audit.

The coin also has only $330,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it could crash quickly if a whale decides to dump holdings.

Its small market cap leaves plenty of room for growth if altcoin markets keep heating up.

However, traders should be cautious with this token, as it’s tough to do due diligence.

Elsewhere, another Ethereum meme coin, Ethereum Doge (EDOGE), is pumping hard, rallying 170% in 24 hours, ranking it as another one of the top crypto gainers today.

Per DEXScreener, its market cap was last around $5.8 million, with around $350,000 in locked liquidity.

Unlike Terminus, Ethereum Doge appears to have a decent community. It has nearly 2,000 followers on Twitter and just under 2,000 in its Telegram group.

EDOGE’s seemingly strong community is reflected on DEXScreener’s platform – The token has 862 rocket ship emoji upvotes versus just 58 red flag emoji upvotes.

Community is the lifeblood of any meme coin that wants longevity.

So, if Ethereum Doge actually has it, it could be a better bet than Terminus.

Still, traders must always do their own due diligence and never risk more than they can afford to lose.

The final token worth noting is a Solana meme coin called Conan (CONAN), which is themed after Donald Trump’s dog.

CONAN is up 80% in 24 hours, per DEXScreener, with its market cap reaching $8.5 million and the token amassing $220,000 in locked liquidity.

While the token appears popular amongst DEXScreener users, with 444 rocket ship emoji votes to just 50 red flag votes, traders must always be cautious.

Nearly all newly launched tokens are scams or pump-and-dumps of some description.

Better Alternative?
Trading in the DEX markets is fraught with risks.

The risk of buying a token that ends up as a rug pull of some sort is high.

Traders also risk making bad buy or sell decisions due to FOMO or fear.

A potentially much safer way to get into low market cap tokens early is to invest in crypto presales.

Presales also normally last a few weeks, giving investors ample time to do their due diligence before risking their hard-earned cash.

The blockchain industry continues to grow as the technology advances.

Recent findings from Precedence Research predict that the global blockchain technology market will reach $187 billion by 2034. The report notes that the North American blockchain market was estimated to be worth $8.1 billion last year.

While notable, industry experts believe that privacy is a top concern for enterprises adopting blockchain solutions.

Paul Brody, Global Blockchain Leader for Ernst & Young (EY), told Cryptonews that privacy technology is still relatively immature. This is a challenge, as Brody mentioned that the number one issue for enterprise users and serious institutional investors is privacy.


“For any business activity – things like what you are buying, your terms and conditions, and volumes and spend – are very sensitive and competitive issues,” Brody said. “Blockchains just aren’t usable for businesses without that capability.”

Public Blockchains Lack Privacy
Unfortunately, public blockchains don’t contain native privacy features.


Avidan Abitbol, Project Director of Data Ownership Protocol (DOP), told Cryptonews that there is a problem with balancing transparency and data ownership within blockchain systems.

“In traditional blockchain networks, all transaction data is publicly visible, which can make users vulnerable,” Abitbol said.

Given this, private blockchain networks are likely gaining traction amongst enterprises.

Findings from technology firm Wipro show that 40-60% of enterprises have deployed private blockchain networks – exclusive networks with limited access, making them more centralized.

Jake Claver, Director of Digital Ascension Group – a family office specializing in digital assets – told Cryptonews that he believes financial institutions and corporations typically operate in permissioned ecosystems.

For instance, Claver mentioned that the permissioned blockchain network R3 Corda is the main solution provider that Digital Ascension Group sees the majority of institutions leveraging.

A Privacy Solution For Public Blockchain Advances
While private blockchains may be popular with enterprises, a number of privacy solutions geared towards public networks are advancing rapidly.

For example, Brody mentioned that EY has built an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) network called “Nightfall” that allows businesses to move tokens around confidentially. Nightfall was launched in 2019, yet the rise of tokenization has helped the solution advance.

“Every business agreement amounts to an exchange of money for products or services under the terms of an agreement,” Brody said. “With blockchains you can tokenize the money and the products and you can write the terms into a smart contract.”

Brody added that EY has created an application called “Starlight,” which allows businesses to take a solidity smart contract and turn it into a customized zero knowledge circuit.

“This is a kind of customized private black-box on-chain,” he remarked.


Public Blockchain Transparency Becomes Private
DOP also seeks to solve the problem of balancing transparency and data ownership in public blockchain systems.

Abitbol pointed out that DOP does this through “selective transparency,” which allows users to control how much of their information is shared on a blockchain.

“DOP’s selective transparency features allow organizations to share only the necessary information with their stakeholders, such as partners, clients, customers, and employees, while keeping sensitive data protected and concealed,” Abitbol said.


He explained that integrating DOP into an enterprise blockchain solution allows an organization to mask any type of data.

“For instance, when an enterprise pays salaries in cryptocurrency, without DOP, employees could potentially trace the transactions back to the company’s main wallet and access information about other employees’ salaries, the company’s overall crypto holdings, or other sensitive financial data,” Abitbol added. “This lack of privacy could lead to various issues, such as internal conflicts, information leaks, or even attempts at manipulation.”

According to Abitbol, DOP enables enterprises to disclose only the essential data required for each specific transaction, ensuring that sensitive information stays confidential.

DOP is an EVM-compatible protocol and contains key features such as encryption of token balances and transaction data. Abitbol added that DOP can be integrated with popular wallets and blockchain platforms.

Recording Private Transactions on a Public Network
Charles Adkins, President of Hedera – an open-source public ledger – further told Cryptonews that Hedera is able to provide public permissions in its network through the “Hedera Consensus Service” (HCS).

According to the Hedera website, HCS enables verifiable timestamps, decentralized ordering, and privacy for sensitive information, for enterprise applications and consortiums.

Adkins added that on private networks HCS can be used to record the state of private transactions on the public ledger. This allows for privacy while still benefiting from the trust and security that a public blockchain offers.


“Hedera ensures that transaction privacy is maintained by only submitting a hash of the transactions to the public ledger, which can be used later for verification without revealing any sensitive details,” Adkins said.

He also noted that since transactions on private networks may not be public, these can still be anchored to the public Hedera Layer 1 network for consensus.

“This means that while private networks may handle sensitive or private data internally, they can use Hedera’s mainnet for final consensus, ensuring a high degree of security and decentralization without compromising privacy,” he remarked.

Challenges With Privacy Solutions For Public Blockchains
While it’s important to understand how privacy solutions are advancing, a number of challenges may hamper adoption.

For instance, Brody pointed out that the math behind the solutions created by EY is difficult to understand.

“Because the math is complex, that leads to high gas fees on-chain, so driving down the cost of each transaction is very important,” he commented. “We currently can do transactions for as little as $0.01 with privacy, which is important, but we’re aiming for another 10x reduction in cost.”

Additionally, Brody mentioned that customized digital contracts still require a lot of human support.

With this in mind, Brody hopes that EY can soon implement no-code drag-and-drop smart contacts to create business agreements with privacy on-chain.

“Our goal is relentless simplification to the point where nobody will really know or care what the core math or technology is behind the system. They’ll just know that it works,” he said.

Technology aside, Adkins believes that balancing transparency with the need for confidentiality remains problematic.

“Businesses require privacy for sensitive transactions, yet they also want the benefits of immutability and verification that public blockchains provide,” he said.

Another issue Adkins pointed out is regulatory compliance.

“Ensuring that the blockchain network adheres to privacy laws such as GDPR, which requires the right to be forgotten, a concept that’s difficult to reconcile with immutable ledgers,” he remarked.

Enterprise Blockchain Will Continue To Thrive
Despite challenges, enterprise blockchain adoption will continue to flourish moving forward.

Claver predicts that institutions will solve challenges related to digital identity, liquidity and regulations before the end of this year.

“There is an urgent need for institutions and enterprises to adopt blockchain technology to prevent a global liquidity crisis,” he commented.

Echoing this, Adkins noted that “enterprises are waking up to the reality that blockchain can bring unparalleled efficiency to their operations.”
Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin, USDT, faces mounting scrutiny due to its lack of third-party audits and alleged financial opacity. As concerns spread about a potential collapse akin to the FTX debacle, Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons has been vocal about Tether’s operations, calling it a $118 billion “scam” that could destabilize the entire crypto ecosystem.

Despite Tether’s dominance, its opaque business practices, including the lack of a formal audit of its reserves, have raised alarms in the crypto community.

Growing Concerns Over Tether’s Transparency: Is This The Next FTX?
Justin Bons, a crypto analyst and founder of Cyber Capital, recently ignited fresh fears about Tether’s opaque financial operations. In a detailed 17-part thread on X (formerly Twitter), Bons alleged that Tether could be a larger fraud than the now-collapsed FTX exchange.

According to Bons, Tether’s claim of holding $118 billion in collateral lacks any verifiable proof, and the company has yet to undergo a legitimate third-party audit since its inception in 2014.

Bons pointed out that although Tether released an “auditor’s report” with BDO in 2021, this is not the same as a full audit.

“An ‘Auditor’s Report’ or an ‘Accountant Report’ is not a formal audit at all.”

Bons added that Tether had promised a comprehensive audit all the way back in 2015 but failed to deliver.


According to Bons, the absence of transparency makes Tether one of the most significant risks to the entire crypto market, potentially bigger than the infamous collapses of FTX and Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme combined.

Tether’s influence over the market is vast. After a 20% increase in the past two years, it holds 75% of the entire stablecoin market.

Bons argued that this outsized dominance, coupled with the firm’s questionable financial reporting, can potentially disrupt the crypto space, much like the FTX collapse that led to $8.9 billion in user losses.


Questions About Governance: Can Tether Survive an FTX-Like Collapse?
In 2021, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) fined Tether $41 million for lying about its reserves. The regulatory body found that Tether had falsely claimed reserves fully backed its USDT at all times.

However, the stablecoin issuer has since refused to undergo a comprehensive audit.

Bons also raised concerns about Tether’s governance structure following its recent $102 million investment in Latin American agricultural giant Adecoagro.

This investment revealed that Tether Holdings is controlled by only two board members.

This sparks fears that the reserves backing USDT are neither transparent nor segregated. This level of centralization raises red flags, especially in an industry that values decentralization and transparency.

Bons highlighted that several Tether founders have ties to Bitfinex, a crypto exchange previously linked to money laundering and organized crime through its banking partner, Crypto Capital.

These connections add to the perception that Tether may not be as financially secure as it claims.

While concerns over Tether’s operations continue to grow, some industry experts believe Tether may be too big to fail.

Experts like Sean Lee, co-founder of IDA Finance, said in a statement that, during the 2022 bear market, USDC (another stablecoin) de-pegged due to its reliance on troubled banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, while Tether remained stable.

Nevertheless, questions remain about Tether’s long-term viability. Anndy Lian, an intergovernmental blockchain expert, also warned that Tether’s unchecked control over a substantial portion of the market is at odds with the decentralized principles upon which cryptocurrencies were founded.

Tensor Opens the Vault: NFT Finance Layer Now Fully Open-Source on Solana
Tensor, a Solana-based NFT marketplace, announced at the Solana Breakpoint conference that its codebase is now fully open source.

By making the code public, Tensor unlocks several key benefits for the non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem. Developers can now build and deploy applications utilizing Tensor’s NFT tools like automated market maker (AMM) pools without any restrictions. Additionally, the platform offers free Web2 API support, making it easier for developers to integrate Tensor functionalities into their existing projects.

“True to our original vision, we now have the Open NFT Finance Layer on Solana,” said Richard Wu in a X post from Sept. 20.


To incentivize app creation and protocol adoption, Tensor also implemented a fair revenue-sharing model. A 50/50 fee split between the Tensor Foundation and developers ensures that both parties benefit from the success of the platform. Tensor itself also collects a 2% protocol fee.

Tensor Unveils Ambitious Roadmap
Additionally, at the Solana’s conference, Tensor unveiled its plans, which includes advanced features such as collateralized lending, trading bots, and vertical marketplaces for gaming and tokenized collectibles.

To further support the growth of the ecosystem, the Tensor Foundation also launches milestone-based grants to initiatives aimed at increasing the adoption of Tensor protocols.


Solana NFT Market: Mixed Signals
Magic Eden continues to dominate the Solana NFT marketplace landscape, securing the top spot with a commanding 53.9% market share and a trading volume of $1.26 million in the past 24 hours. Tensor closely follows in second place, capturing 43.2% of the market share and generating a trading volume of $1.02 million, as per TIEXO data.

However, despite this surge in NFT sales volume, Solana’s NFT marketplace activity remains volatile.

While overall NFT sales volume on Solana-based NFT marketplaces saw a significant increase of 38.2% in the past 24 hours, reaching $2.39 million or 16.25 SOL, the broader picture reveals a more challenging trend. Throughout August and early September, trading volumes experienced substantial declines. The 7-day trading volume dropped by 38.7%, and the 1-month volume plummeted by 51.5%. This indicates that while there have been short-term spikes, the overall market sentiment for Solana NFTs remains uncertain.

TNSR, Tensor’s governance token launched in March, has been on a steady upward trajectory over the past few weeks. Over the past 24 hours, the coin has gained 1.4%. Looking at the weekly chart, TNSR has experienced a more substantial rise, with gains of 12.8% and 17.7% over the past seven and 14 days, respectively.
In an exclusive interview with Cryptonews Podcast, host Matt Zahab talked to Edison Chen, the co-founder and CEO of CUDIS, the company behind the first Web3 and AI-powered wellness ring.

Chen discussed the CUDIS 001 ring, why rings are better than watches and bands, how vital it is for every person to truly own their data, and how they can financially benefit from it.

He explained why charging monthly fees is a “weird” business model and talked about the $5 million funding round led by Draper Associates.

One Smart Ring to Rule Them All
CUDIS 001 on Solana is “the first AI smart ring that rewards your wellness journey,” its creators said.

Users fully own their data and earn daily rewards, “turning a healthy lifestyle into a new store of on-chain value.”

But why a ring among the many types of wearable products?


Chen explained that based on his experience and the team’s research, rings are primed for growth in the market, which is overwhelmed with watches and bands.

So, there is no reason to build another one of the same product.

“For the smart ring, I think we can build something better than what already exists in the market,” Chen said.


Another key reason is data accuracy. The team argues that products worn on a finger provide more precise data than those worn on the wrist.

Finally, there is the need to fill the gap between the user and the product.

Popular wearable smart product brands are currently using the subscription model.

And while monthly payments may sound like a recipe for sustainable revenue, it’s “actually a bad business model,” Chen remarked.

He gave a simple example: it’s like buying a house, but when you try to input the door passcode, the seller says you haven’t paid the maintenance fee this month, and you can’t enter. “It’s weird.”

Apple is an example of a job well done, Chen said. It sells phones that you can always access. The company charges fees for additional apps, not for using the phone.

Your Data, Your Choice, Your Money
Continuing the above thought, Chen noted that companies should not charge users every month only to remove access to their own data should they fail to pay or the company shut down.

Another problem is that companies don’t make it easy/possible for users to check their data like they would, say, their bank accounts.

And data is valuable! It’s an asset. Yet, those providing it can’t access and earn from it.

That’s one of the things CUDIS wants to change.


The team wants to make it really simple for all users to check their health and wellness data – including the complete history – like they would their wallet transactions.

This will take a bit longer to build, but “hopefully, we can bring this to the user, let’s say the first or second quarter next year,” Chen said.

This will return data ownership to the user, who will decide what to do with it.

Users can also financially benefit from selling the data or sharing it to contribute to building a project.

“I think that’s the region that we are seeking in the future,” Chen added.

The Future is Bright
Wellness data is going to be very important to everybody in the next decade, Chen argued.

People are spending increasingly more time and money on wellness and are more aware of data ownership.

Another welcome use case is that, in the future, users can grant their doctors access to the information gathered by their rings – providing a full insight into their physical stare.

What CUDIS does now is help users track the data and store it on the IPFS.

But in the near future, the data will go on-chain. It will stay there forever – meaning that users will own their data forever for the first time in history – and no shuttering company can take away one’s access to it.


This will also allow users to move data to another wearable product application. They are encouraged to do what they’d like with it.

“But we would love to build ourselves into one of the best, and people won’t want to move to other things,” Chen said.

Users will also be able to manage data from multiple places – like Strava, Comms, and SleepCycle – in one app.

“We support people to sync up their data from Apple. We are under reviewing with Google Play with Google Fit part, and they take a little more time,” Chen added.

If You Build It, They Will Come
CUDIS is a startup, Chen said, and it’s important for it to generate funds to survive.

Once a company generates substantial revenue sustainably, it can do more for the end user.

Therefore, CUDIS wants to serve a small group of people first, currently around 8,000 ring buyers.

The next step is to open up the app to other users to get more feedback and grow the business on a larger scale.

As for CUDIS’ business model, the CEO said there is no monthly fee. “You don’t pay for the CUDIS app to check your daily data.”

Later, the company may add premium features.


CUDIS is currently inviting builders to join its builder program. Anything related to wellness, including sleep, supplements, online courses, offline gyms, and much more, is welcomed.

“We have real quality users and can help you to build up the business,” Chen said.

Unlike other companies, CUDIS enables builders to communicate with the users who will help them create and improve the product.

Builders pay for the user’s data, and once they have the product ready, CUDIS helps them promote it in the market.

“It’s really low cost, and we use real users,” said Chen. “The realm of the generating together with CUDIS, we also take like 15% to 20%. So it’s kind of like Apple.”

Additionally, as users are paid, they are essentially co-contributors, Chen remarked. Therefore, they’d probably like to support the product once it launches.

“And if you really can build something to solve a real-world problem, I think someone will pay for that for sure,” he added.

Going After General Consumer Market
Just recently, CUDIS raised $5 million from Draper Associates, Skybridge, and other notable investors.

The team will use the funds to expand the supply chain and increase production capacity.

They’ll invest more in R&D, branding, and marketing.


“The next stage for us is to definitely go after the general consumer market,” Chen added.

People will easily understand the ring as the first AI/Web3 wellness product and the first crypto-related consumer product, he remarked.

Therefore, the team aims to work with “a lot of the large brands in the future” to promote its concept.

Lastly, part of the funding will go into offline events and online campaigns to show people they have another option to own and control their data, Chen concluded.

olana (SOL) is back in the news, but not for its price movements. Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of Solana Labs, has just unveiled its second crypto-centric smartphone, ‘Seeker,’ to be released in 2025.

That is not Solana’s first venture into the mobile phone and tech industry, as ‘Seeker’ is an advanced version of the previously developed ‘Saga.’

While this move has generated excitement, it seems some investors haven’t bought into the hype. Many are shifting their attention instead to promising altcoins like RCO Finance (RCOF), which has the potential for significant growth in the DeFi space.

New Solana Phone Triggers a Price Shift
During the Token 2049 conference, Solana announced exciting updates to their mobile device development, promising to deliver “More for Less.” This development has caught the eye of crypto and tech enthusiasts alike. With over 140,000 preorders already, demand is outpacing expectations.

The Solana device is designed to work directly with the blockchain. It features a Seed Vault for enhanced asset security and an improved store for dApps.


This development caused Solana’s price to shoot by over 5% within the past 24 hours. Market analysts are forecasting potential price fluctuations for SOL, with short-term projections between $150 and $172.

This expected volatility presents risks and opportunities for traders engaging with dynamic price movements. However, large-cap tokens like Solana often offer less potential for price explosion, leading some to look for altcoins and ICOs with lower market caps and strong fundamentals.

RCO Finance (RCOF) Presale Takes Off
While Solana continues to capture audiences with its innovative phone launch, RCO Finance (RCOF) is making ripples in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.

RCOF has seen remarkable growth, with its presale raising over $2 million from investors.

The trading platform has developed a unique AI-driven robo-advisor tool that is the heart of its services. The tool crafts customized investment strategies by analyzing each user’s financial goals and risk tolerance.

The tool’s machine learning algorithm sifts through vast swathes of market data, from historical trends to real-time price changes, to provide tailored recommendations. This offers novice traders the insights and confidence needed to start their trading journey.

RCO Finance also offers exposure to over 150,000 assets through tokenization, linking DeFi and TradFi. Users can invest in traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate using their crypto holdings.

This simplifies the investment process, allowing them to invest in different asset classes without converting digital currencies to fiat. Moreover, thanks to the platform’s debit card, investors can access their yield anywhere in the world without geo-restrictions.

Security is a top priority for RCO Finance, and they have partnered with Fireblocks for secure integrations, while RCOF’s altcoin smart contracts have been audited by SolidProof.

Additionally, RCO Finance embraces a no-KYC policy, allowing users to maintain anonymity while adhering to regulations.

Why Join RCO Finance (RCOF)?
The RCO Finance (RCOF) presale is currently underway, offering an opportunity for investors to get in early on its growth potential. Each token is priced at $0.0344, and presale participants can enjoy a 50% token bonus when they use the code RCOF50 at purchase.

The project’s tokenomics are crafted for long-term stability with a total supply limit of 800 million tokens and a deflationary mechanism. This approach will reduce the altcoin’s supply over time, potentially boosting the token’s value.

RCOF holders enjoy more than just the potential for high income. They gain governing rights, priority customer support, access to DeFi lending pools, and trading fee discounts of up to 40%.

RCO Finance also offers high leverage options, up to 1000x on certain trades, allowing investors to potentially maximize returns with a smaller initial investment. However, traders should note that the risk is much higher when trading with leverage.

With features like liquidity pools and yield farming, RCO Finance provides an exciting new platform where users can earn passive income while managing portfolios.

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson warned on Friday that Donald Trump’s newly launched crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, could face serious political and regulatory challenges.

He highlighted the potential for investigations by institutions like the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the SEC, emphasizing the risk of politicizing the entire crypto industry.

Trump’s Crypto Platform Could Trigger Political Polarization
During a September 20 interview with the Financial Times, Hoskinson raised alarm over the launch of Trump’s World Liberty Financial, a new decentralized finance (DeFi) platform supported by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.


Hoskinson characterized the launch of this platform as potentially “scary” for the cryptocurrency industry, emphasizing the risks associated with political polarization.

Political polarization is the growing divide and stark differences in political beliefs, values, and ideologies between groups, often leading to extreme positions and a lack of compromise.


In this context, Hoskinson explained that Trump’s crypto platform, which is regarded as a decentralized finance (DeFi) application, could create challenges for the industry, as everything Trump does is perceived to attract major opposition from political actors and parties.

The Cardano founder elaborated on the implications of such a politicized environment, warning that Democrats may attempt to weaponize the institutions of the state to slow down and damage Trump.

He believes this could ultimately lead to regulatory investigations by the Department of Justice (DoJ) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) targeting Trump’s crypto platform.

World Liberty Financial has been introduced as a potential tool to bolster the U.S. presence in the global crypto space. However, specifics around its operational framework and regulatory compliance remain unclear.

Concerns Over World Liberty Financial and Its Long-Term Viability
The recent announcement of World Liberty Financial has drawn substantial interest, but many investors remain skeptical due to unanswered questions about the platform’s operations, regulatory approach, and strategies for gaining market traction.


Without clarity on security measures and compliance with financial regulations, confidence in the platform’s long-term success remains shaky.

Hoskinson’s concerns amplify these doubts, as he warned that political backlash could invite scrutiny from regulatory bodies, complicating the launch of World Liberty Financial’s proposed token (WLFI).

While Trump’s pivot toward crypto may resonate with his political base, it remains uncertain if this will be enough to compete against established industry giants like Binance and Coinbase.

The ongoing lack of clarity regarding World Liberty Financial’s regulatory status raises concerns about its long-term viability, echoing Hoskinson’s warnings of the risks the industry faces due to political polarization.
TRON Network and Dogecoin have been fighting fiercely to maintain their positions in the top 10 crypto market cap rankings. On the other hand, lesser-known cryptocurrencies have been garnering more and more investor attention with their strong price rallies and successful presales.

One such example is Rollblock, a project that raised over $3.6 million (and counting) during its presale and managed to attract over 15,000 daily active users. Here’s why experts believe it could become a top altcoin in 2024.

TRON Network ($TRX) on the Verge of Breakout
In the past 30 days, $TRON processed nearly 60 million in USDT transfers, which shows increased activity and interest on the network. Although $TRON is still trying to catch up to its Q2 bullish momentum when daily transactions surged by 29%, its recent resilience shows that the token is headed in the right direction.

For now, $TRON is trading at $0.1497 after a minor intra-day dip of 0.78%. Despite this decline, its market cap of $12.97 billion still makes it the 10th largest cryptocurrency. Since $TRON is currently trading above its key simple moving averages, its price could experience more upswings in the next few weeks.

Dogecoin ($DOGE) Could Turn Bullish Again
Last week, Dogecoin recorded over 1.93 million transactions as the meme-based token began a bullish rebound. Although this transaction count is still far from Dogecoin’s February highs, it is still a bullish signal for savvy traders. Dogecoin’s active addresses have also surged by 26% in the last 24 hours, suggesting a sudden spike in activity on its network.

$DOGE is currently trading at $0.1006 after a small intra-day decline of 1.02%. Despite the sudden dip, Dogecoin is still the 8th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. If bullish momentum picks up again, Dogecoin could test the nearest $0.11 resistance soon. However, reaching the $1 milestone still seems like a difficult feat for Dogecoin.

Rollblock ($RBLK) Soars Through Presale Milestones; $3.6 Million Raised
While Rollblock ($RBLK) is a relatively new project on the market, it has already demonstrated promising potential during its ongoing presale. Within just a few months of its presale launch, Rollblock’s crypto-native casino has managed to attract over 15,000 daily active users, with its presale raising over $3.6 million.

rollblock presale
The new GambleFi token seemingly has a bright future ahead, with an article from CoinMarketCap stating that Rollblock will be the first GambleFi token to break into the top 10 cryptos by market cap before 2028. The article justifies this optimistic outlook with Rollblock’s approach to casinos, where they combined decentralized and centralized gambling into one Ethereum-backed casino platform, as well as with the expansion of the gambling market, which is expected to expand to $750 billion by 2028.

Through Ethereum’s backing, Rollblock’s casino offers top-notch security measures such as no KYC verifications, encrypted bets, and transparent analytics.

Since Rollblock uses its native $RBLK token for all in-game payouts and rewards, the token naturally comes with a strong use case from the get-go. However, $RBLK investors stand to profit from the token’s potential upswings even if they don’t engage in Rollblock’s massive game collection with more than 7,000 AI-powered titles, as they can still net a profit through Rollblock’s revenue-sharing mechanism.

Every week, Rollblock repurchases $RBLK on the open market and redistributes them as staking rewards to current investors. These long-term holders don’t just receive a passive income but also enjoy one of the highest APYs in the market.

Due to the aforementioned features, it is no surprise that Rollblock’s presale (currently in the 6th stage) is already nearing the end in record time.
Congressman Rich McCormick (R-GA) called on the U.S. Department of State on Wednesday to intervene in freeing Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan, who has been detained by Nigerian authorities since February of this year.

McCormick described Gambaryan as a “hostage” during a hearing hosted by the Committee of Foreign Affairs, emphasizing the need for immediate action to secure his release.

U.S. Lawmakers Demand Action for Binance Executive’s Release
During the hearing, McCormick questioned Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell on why the U.S. government had not yet secured Gambaryan’s freedom.


Gambaryan, who traveled to Nigeria for discussions on crypto policy, was detained and has since been held on money laundering charges.

Rich McCormick pointed out that Gambaryan met most of the conditions outlined in the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act, but still remains imprisoned.


“We very much want to get it resolved and it is a subject of real concern,” Campbell responded, acknowledging the ongoing diplomatic efforts.

Tigran Gambaryan’s Health Concerns Worsen Amid Detainment
As legal and diplomatic efforts continue, growing concerns about Gambaryan’s health have added further urgency to his case.

Reports have surfaced that Gambaryan is suffering from significant health issues, compounded by a lack of medical care while in custody.

A video from a September 2 court appearance shows the Binance executive struggling to walk, nearly in tears.


“I’m not okay,” Gambaryan cried in the video, clearly distressed. “Why couldn’t I use a goddamn wheelchair? This is a show. I’m innocent—why are you doing this to me?”

McCormick echoed these concerns on social media, stating that Gambaryan had been “regularly denied access to much-needed medical care and his lawyers.”

The Congressman warned that Gambaryan’s health is in serious decline and urged the State Department to elevate his case.

“His family has not hugged him in over 7 months. Time is running out. We need the State Department to elevate his case and bring him home NOW,” McCormick posted.

McCormick is not alone in his call for Gambaryan’s release. In June, Representatives French Hill (R-AR) and Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA) visited the imprisoned Binance executive, discovering that he had been suffering from malaria and double pneumonia.


“Tigran must be immediately granted a humanitarian release, the remaining charges dropped, and he must return home to America where he belongs,” Hill said in a statement following the visit.

Gambaryan’s condition has worsened since then. He is reportedly suffering from a herniated disc and has not received adequate treatment.

His wife, Yuki, expressed her frustration over the situation in a statement earlier this month.

“They cannot keep playing games with my husband’s life like this,” Gambaryan’s wife, Yuki, said in a statement shared with cryptonews.com earlier this month. “This entire situation is inhumane and degrading, and I am fed up. There must be consequences for this disregard of law and human rights.”
aspa’s price has shown resilience, with analysts identifying key levels that could determine its next move. Meanwhile, Uniswap news includes CEO Hayden Adams addressing bribery allegations, reinforcing the platform’s commitment to transparency.

Alongside these top crypto coins, BlockDAG is gaining serious traction with its recent Testnet launch. This major milestone offers developers a scalable platform for dApps and NFTs, sparking demand for its coin. With predictions of a 20,000X ROI, BlockDAG is becoming one of the most anticipated projects in the current market.


Kaspa Price Analysis: Fibonacci Barriers & Support Zones
According to a recent analysis, Kaspa’s price is currently at $0.1628, with its all-time high (ATH) at $0.2075. Crypto analyst Cryptographur highlighted Kaspa’s growing market strength, driven by increased miner confidence and a rising hash rate. While Kaspa’s price has shown resilience, with strong buying support during dips, several key price levels present potential barriers.

The 0.617 Fibonacci level at $0.1780 is considered a psychological hurdle, while the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $0.1896 represents the final major barrier before a retest of the ATH. On the downside, Kaspa’s price faces significant support at the 0.382 Fibonacci level at $0.1566 and a lower defense at $0.1446. Kaspa’s current momentum suggests both challenges and potential ahead.


Uniswap News: CEO Denies Deployment Bribery Claims
Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain, has recently faced bribery allegations. Claims surfaced accusing Uniswap of charging $20 million for protocol deployment, causing widespread debate within the cryptocurrency community.

Hayden Adams, CEO of Uniswap Labs, firmly denied these accusations, clarifying that neither Uniswap Labs nor the Uniswap Foundation charges for protocol deployment. Instead, he emphasized that the governance process is driven by community voting, ensuring fairness and transparency.

These allegations come alongside other legal challenges for Uniswap, including a settlement with the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Despite the controversies, Uniswap continues to be a key player in the DeFi sector, with the UNI token currently priced at $6.71, experiencing a minor 0.48% decline.


BlockDAG’s Testnet Launch Powers Growth & Drives Coin Value Surge
BlockDAG’s recently launched Testnet offers much more than just a playground for creating decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs. It delivers a powerful, scalable platform that developers can fully tap into, providing the technical strength needed for long-term growth.

This launch solidifies BlockDAG’s ability to attract developers, boost network activity, and increase the overall utility of the blockchain. These factors—more developers, increased usage, and growing demand—are key elements that could drive the platform toward the moon.

For holders of 7,500+ BDAG coins or more, the Testnet launch brings the opportunity to migrate assets from the devnet, whether earned through mining apps like X1 Miner or acquired by purchasing BDAG. This migration secures an early position in a growing network, offering access to a platform poised for significant value growth as its ecosystem expands.

BlockDAG has already sold over 13 billion BDAG coins, raising almost $73.5 million to date. The price has increased by 1680%, from $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0178 today. With the Testnet live and activity increasing, the project is set for continued growth, positioning early adopters to benefit from the next phase of expansion.

Future Outlook
Kaspa continues to show resilience in its price movements, with key Fibonacci levels shaping its potential path. Uniswap, despite facing allegations, remains a crucial player in DeFi as it addresses transparency concerns and navigates legal challenges. However, BlockDAG is gaining the most momentum of the three.

With its Testnet now fully operational, offering developers a stable and scalable platform to create dApps and NFTs, BlockDAG is seeing increased demand. Currently priced at $0.0178, BDAG has already experienced impressive growth, and the coin’s future looks exceptionally promising.
The Notcoin (NOT) price could be set to explode as it probes for a breakout above its 21DMA for the first time in weeks.

Last, at $0.0077, the Notcoin price is trading almost bang on its 21DMA after moving slightly above it earlier in the day.

If the Notcoin price closes above $0.0080, it could send a trading signal that huge gains may be in store for NOT holders.

Notcoin Price Set to Explode?
If NOT could also break above its 50DMA at $0.0094, it could signal that the Notcoin price has broken out of its downtrend since its early June highs.

And that could mean NOT’s next stop would be the $0.0025s or higher.

A rebound isn’t guaranteed. In recent months, the Notcoin price has threatened but ultimately failed to break above its 21DMA.


NOT could be setting up for gains of 3-4x from current levels.

As a result, the tap-to-earn Telegram-based GameFi token could thus rank as one of the best cryptos to buy today.

Notcoin Price Might Explode, But This Crypto Could Be a Better Bet
The Notcoin price might be about to explode alongside a broader crypto market rally.

The Fed just started axing interest rates, but the US economy remains relatively robust, which could be a goldilocks combination for risk assets.

However, some traders might be looking for greater upside potential than the 3-4x upside offered by the Notcoin price.

One of the best ways to secure big gains is to invest in a high-potential but new crypto project in a fast-growing sector within Web3.

New Telegram crypto casino Mega Dice (DICE) could be just the ticket.

Mega Dice seamlessly blends the fast-growing GambleFi and GameFi niches, and its ease of use, thanks to its Telegram integration, gives it a significant advantage over competitors.

Its native token, DICE, is currently available in presale, and dozens of crypto experts are recommending the coin to their followers.

Crypto June thinks Mega Dice could topple current market leader Rollbit.


And Michael Wrubel is also bullish on DICE, per a YouTube video shared with his 312,000 subscribers.
South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) pledged on September 20 to actively support the second phase of crypto legislation.

According to a recent report by Digital Today, FSC officials emphasized the need for a level playing field as the virtual asset industry increasingly intersects with traditional finance, focusing on business activity regulations and real-name accounts for corporations and institutions.

South Korea Targets Global Regulation Standards
The new legislation addresses regulatory challenges related to security tokens and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) while ensuring global compatibility and robust investor protection.

The initiative to implement the second phase of crypto legislation follows recent discussions highlighting the urgency of adapting regulatory frameworks.

Authorities are considering revising the Capital Market Act to include clearer guidelines on digital assets.

One key aspect under consideration is issuing real-name accounts for corporations and institutions.


This move is expected to improve transparency and accountability, providing a legal foundation for corporate participation in the virtual asset market, predominantly dominated by individual investors.

In addition, the FSC has indicated that the new regulations will cover the operation and qualification requirements for virtual asset service providers.

This includes stricter standards for anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures.

The Commission expressed the need for collaboration with global regulatory bodies to ensure that South Korea’s approach to digital asset regulation is in sync with evolving global standards, reducing the risk of regulatory arbitrage and fostering a safer environment for investors.

$107 Million Seized During Last Year
South Korea’s Joint Virtual Asset Investigation Team has seized $107 million in assets from suspects involved in crypto-related fraud over the past year.

Since its launch, the unit, based in the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office, has indicted 41 individuals and arrested 18.

The unit, including officials from the Financial Supervisory Service, the Korea Exchange, and the National Tax Service, has handled high-profile cases involving luxury assets such as supercars and properties in affluent areas like Gangnam.

Is Altcoin Season Upon Us? Fed Rate Cut Spurs Investors to Go Risk-On
The US Federal Reserve’s decision to ease interest rates by 50 basis points has pushed investors to take on risk assets, raising anticipations of an altcoin season.

To Mason Jappa, CEO and founder of U.S.-based Bitcoin miner Blockware, the medium to long-term outlook for cryptocurrency remains bullish, as lower interest rates tend to support risk-on assets like Bitcoin.

Speaking to Cryptonews, he noted that “if Powell comes out with extremely dovish rhetoric, crypto will likely see a brief pump,” something which unfolded, reflected by overwhelming market optimism and a shift towards risk-on assets.

Altcoins saw significant benefits from this, with significant inflows as new hands entered the market, pushing its market cap up $22 billion over the past 24 hours, according to Coingecko data.

This turn of events echoes pseudonymous analyst Mustache’s comments that traders are “not bullish enough” on altcoins. Mustache cited historical patterns as the basis for an impending altcoin season that will extend into 2025.


Has Altcoin Season Started?
Despite the recent uptick in altcoin trading, on-chain metrics suggest that altcoins still have room to grow before a clear altcoin season sets in.


According to Coincodex data, Bitcoin’s dominance has only been minorly affected. It has declined 0.6% since the Fed rate decision. While this represents a shift towards altcoins, Bitcoin still maintains an overwhelming presence.

Blockchaincenter.net’s Altcoin Season index chart reinforces this, currently at 45, a neutral zone.

This is far from the benchmark of 75, which signifies an altcoin season in full swing as capital flows away from Bitcoin to alts.

Meanwhile, the top 50 altcoins by market cap show marked underperformance compared to Bitcoin.

Over the past 90 days, only a select few altcoins have managed to outpace the leading cryptocurrency, with most still deep in the red. While a 75% outperformance is seen as the benchmark for an altcoin season, currently, just shy of 50% of altcoins outpace Bitcoin.

Analyst Point Next Two Quarters for Altseason Kick-Off
Although the altcoin season may not be in effect yet, in a September 20 X post, pseudonymous analyst Nilesh Rohilla noted a bullish breakout from the descending channel forming on the altcoin market cap chart.

Looking wider, the analyst noted that a Bitcoin breakout would be a stepping stone to a “parabolic” altcoin breakout, unleashing high-gain opportunities.

This sentiment was echoed by other analysts, who pointed to historical and technical patterns as grounds that the final quarter of this year could be a potential Bitcoin breakout point, with a six-figure Bitcoin “still in play” as we move toward 2025.

This forecast aligns with what is expected to be a monumental catalyst: the US presidential election, which will bring new all-time highs due to “positive drivers dominating regardless of the election outcome.

Bitcoin (BTC) extended its upward momentum, trading near $63,000 and reaching an intraday high of $64,059.

This rally is fueled by growing institutional interest and recent news of MicroStrategy purchasing 7,420 additional BTC, increasing its total holdings to 252,220 BTC.


The launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. has also boosted investor confidence and market demand, further propelling BTC’s rise.

MicroStrategy has made another significant Bitcoin (BTC) purchase, acquiring 7,420 BTC between September 13-19, 2024, at an average price of $61,750 per Bitcoin, spending $458.2 million.

This brings their total holdings to 252,220 BTC, purchased for roughly $9.9 billion at an average price of $39,266 per BTC.


With Bitcoin’s current value, their holdings are worth nearly $16 billion, resulting in an unrealized profit of around $6 billion.

CEO Michael Saylor continues to advocate for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. MicroStrategy has also expanded its note offering to $1.01 billion to fund further BTC purchases, signaling potential future acquisitions.

Bitcoin Price Surge Points to Bullish Momentum and Possible New Highs
Bitcoin (BTC) has recently surged, breaking out of a long consolidation phase and boosting investor confidence.

Renowned analyst Michaël van de Poppe predicts that Bitcoin could face resistance at $66,000 but remains optimistic about reaching new all-time highs in October.

Currently, Bitcoin’s record high is $73,780, achieved in March.

All-time high: $73,780
Potential resistance: $66,000
Key events: Bitcoin spot ETFs and fourth halving

With growing market optimism and key events this year—like the Bitcoin spot ETFs and April’s halving—analysts suggest Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by year-end.

Van de Poppe foresees strong gains in the final quarter of 2024.

Bitcoin Tests Key Resistance at $63,000 Amid Bullish Run
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading at $62,770, slightly retracing from its recent high of $63,810. The pair remains bullish within the ascending channel, with immediate resistance at $63,810.

A break above this could push prices toward the next resistance levels at $65,120 and $66,580.

On the downside, immediate support is seen at $62,120, followed by the 50-day EMA at $60,520, which provides solid support for the ongoing trend.


The RSI is currently at 65, signaling overbought conditions, suggesting a minor pullback might occur before any further upward movement.

However, as long as Bitcoin holds above $62,120, the bullish trend is expected to remain intact. Traders should monitor for a potential break below $60,520 for signs of a deeper retracement.

Key Insights:

Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $63,810, with potential targets at $65,120.
RSI at 65 signals overbought conditions, suggesting a possible pullback.
Strong support lies at $62,120, with 50-day EMA reinforcing bullish sentiment at $60,520.

The U.S. government is recommending a lenient sentence for Caroline Ellison, former Alameda Research CEO and ex-girlfriend of Sam Bankman-Fried, following her “extraordinary” testimony in his landmark fraud case last fall.

U.S. Prosecutors Praise Ex-Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison
In a new letter filed to U.S. Southern District of New York Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, prosecutors praised the former crypto executive for her “substantial assistance” in crafting the case against Bankman-Fried and “bringing the most culpable party to justice.”


“The ‘what’ and ‘how’ of the crimes, as well as the ‘why,’ would have been difficult to prove without Ellison’s testimony,” prosecutors wrote.

Thanks to Ellison’s decision to testify, Bankman-Fried was ultimately sentenced and convicted for orchestrating a massive digital asset scheme that misappropriated over $8 billion of investor funds.

The FTX founder tried to discredit his former girlfriend in the leadup to his watershed trial by releasing writings from her personal journal detailing that she was “unhappy” and “overwhelmed” ahead of the crypto exchange’s collapse to “The New York Times” in July 2023; a move that saw SBF’s bail revoked for tampering with a witness.


Similarly, a therapist whom Ellison had confided in shared her personal information with “Moneyball” author Michael Lewis, who later published it in his book about Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto journey, “Going Infinite.”

“The government cannot think of another cooperating witness in recent history who has received a greater level of attention and harassment,” prosecutors elaborated. “The attendant professional consequences of this level of notoriety are obvious and unlikely to be shortlived.”

Sam Bankman-Fried Associates Face The Music
In addition to showing remorse for her participation in the international crypto scheme, lawyers for the U.S. government argue that the former Alameda Research CEO had a “limited role” in defrauding investors of the now-defunct crypto exchange.

“While others, like Ryan Salame, tried to withdraw substantial sums of money from their FTX accounts the days before FTX declared bankruptcy, Ellison did not,” the letter reads.

Salame became the first SBF associate to be sentenced when he received a 7.5-year prison term this past May.

The former FTX Markets CEO has since moved to redact his guilty plea after he claimed the U.S. government failed to fulfill its promise of not investigating his partner, former congressional hopeful Michelle Bond, on campaign finance violations.

Bond pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges this week.

Ellison is set to be sentenced on September 24 in New York City.
With major cryptos set to end the week with healthy gains in the wake of the start of a new Fed rate-cutting cycle, traders looking for top crypto gainers today are turning their focus to the volatile on-chain DEX markets.


Bitcoin (BTC), currently around $62,500, is currently on course to end the week at 5.7%.

Ethereum (ETH), meanwhile, is on course to post nearly 10% weekly gains.

But those gains pale compared to the gains seen by many much smaller tokens in the DEX markets.

Indeed, the top crypto gainers today or on any given day are almost always in the DEX markets.


That’s because low liquidity means a relatively small amount of buy pressure exerts huge upward pressure on prices.

Of course, the opposite is also true—DEX tokens can lose their gains just as rapidly as they gained them.

These are very risky markets, not least because most newly launched coins are almost always either scams or pump-and-dump schemes.

That being said, here are some top crypto gainers today according to the DEX analytics tool DEXScreener.

Top Crypto Gainers Today – Which Are They?
Lemonrocks (LEMON)
A new AI project called Lemonrocks (LEMON) has exploded higher since its launch on Thursday.

According to DEXScreener, its market cap was last around $16.8 million, and it had over $600,000 in locked liquidity.

Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXScreener 
Its 155,000% gain in the past 24 hours makes it one of the top crypto gainers today.

While LEMON looks like a legitimate project, investors must always be cautious.

The token has several concerning aspects, including a modifiable tax and ownership that has yet to be renounced.

Traders must never risk more than they can afford to lose in the DEX markets.

Misha (MISHA)
Elsewhere, the Ethereum meme coin Misha (MISHA), seemingly based on Vitalik Buterin’s dog, is one of the top crypto gainers today.

According to DEXScreener, the crypto was up 7,730% in the past 24 hours and reached a market cap of $5.5 million.

The token has seen a whopping $42 million in trading volumes since its launch late Thursday.

And it has amassed liquidity of around $700 million.

That’s not bad, though if a major whale wanted to cash out, that still wouldn’t be enough liquidity to prevent a massive price crash.

MISHA has one concerning aspect to its smart contract – ownership isn’t renounced.

Traders must thus be very careful with this coin and always do their due diligence before getting involved.

WAGIE (WAGIE)
The last name on the top crypto gainers today list is a new Solana meme coin called WAGIE (WAGIE).

WAGIE’s market cap stayed at 1,870% in the past 24 hours, per DEXScreener, taking its market cap to $1.1 million.

The token has just $100,000 in liquidity and could easily crash to zero.

WAGIE also doesn’t appear to have much by way of community, with weekly engagement on social media.
A better alternative might be for crypto investors to get involved in high-potential crypto presales.

New crypto projects often sell their native token at a discount to early investors.

Crypto presales usually last a few weeks, giving investors ample time to do their due diligence on a project before getting involved.

Analysts at Cryptonews.com monitor the crypto presale market closely. Here are some of their favorite projects right now.

Best Crypto to Buy Now
Best Crypto to Buy Now / Source: Cryptonews
Two days after the Fed’s first rate cut since 2020, major cryptos are still trading with good momentum, and investors are weighing up the best crypto to buy now ahead of a potential October surge.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped back under $63,000 and was slightly in the red in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

Best Crypto to Buy Now September 20 – Sui, Bittensor, Aptos
However, it remains close to weekly highs, and most other major cryptos, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), are trading with gains on Friday.

Risk appetite has picked up substantially since the Fed kicked off its latest rate-cutting cycle with a super-sized 50bps cut.


That’s because optimism is building, and markets could enter a goldilocks period of continued US economic growth combined with Fed easing.


Upcoming US macroeconomic data releases will be of utmost importance, with strong US economic data set to support this feel-good narrative.

October is generally a bullish month in crypto, and traders are wondering which might be the best cryptos to buy now ahead of a potential surge.

Here are some strong performers on Friday that could be strong candidates.

Best Crypto to Buy Now Ahead of Potential October Surge
Sui (SUI)
The upcoming layer-1 blockchain protocol Sui (SUI) will lead the crypto market higher on Friday, with an 11% gain, per CoinMarketCap.

Last around $1.48, SUI went within a whisker of $1.60 earlier in the day.

SUI has been on a tear since breaking above key resistance in the $1.17 area.

Per DeFi Llama, Sui’s TVL just surged to a new record high above $850 million.

TVL refers to the USD value of crypto locked in smart contracts on a blockchain.

Surging TVL is a good proxy for a blockchain’s adoption, and Sui’s TVL could keep rapidly rising in the wake of USDC joining the blockchain.


With SUI set to soon blast back to yearly highs in the $2.20 area, it is a strong candidate for the best crypto to buy now.

Best Crypto to Buy Now September 20 – Sui, Bittensor, Aptos
Bittensor (TAO)
Decentralized machine learning network Bittensor (TAO) is another top gainer today, rising 9% on Friday, according to TradingView.

Since breaking above key resistance in the $360 area, the door is open for a rapid return to record highs in the $760 area.

Best Crypto to Buy Now September 20 – Sui, Bittensor, Aptos
The prospect of quick near 2x gains from TAO’s current levels in the $400 area suggests this AI coin could be the best crypto to buy now.

Aptos (APT)
Another new layer-1 protocol, Aptos (APT), was built by the developers behind Facebook’s failed Libra cryptocurrency and performed well on Friday.

APT rallied 6% to probe resistance in the $7.20 area. A break above here could see it quickly rally 3x back to yearly highs in the $19.50 area.

Best Crypto to Buy Now September 20 – Sui, Bittensor, Aptos
Alternatives to Consider
The above-noted coins could all rally substantially during a potential October surge, with all potentially ranking as the best crypto to buy now.

However, some crypto traders will hunt higher-risk coins with bigger upside potential.

And a good way to get into such coins is via crypto presales.

Presales offer investors the chance to get into high-potential crypto projects early and at a low valuation.

Here are some of the analysts at Cryptonews.com’s top presale picks right now
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Friday its intent to pursue sanctions against Elon Musk.

The decision stems from the Tesla and SpaceX CEO’s failure to appear for a court-ordered testimony related to the SEC’s ongoing investigation into his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, now known as X.

The SEC’s filing highlights that just three hours before his scheduled September 10 testimony, Musk informed the regulatory body he would not appear.

Instead, Musk traveled to Cape Canaveral, Florida, to oversee the SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission launch.

Elon Musk vs. the SEC: A History of Disputes
Musk’s legal team argues that sanctions are excessive and unnecessary, emphasizing that his testimony has been rescheduled for October 3.

This latest clash marks another chapter in the ongoing friction between the renowned entrepreneur and the SEC, however.


The SEC’s investigation centers around potential violations of federal securities laws by Elon Musk during his 2022 purchase of Twitter stock.


Last October, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Musk after he declined to participate in an interview for the investigation. Musk has publicly accused the SEC of harassment through its use of subpoenas.

Will SEC Sanctions Stick to Elon Musk?
While Musk’s lawyers maintain their client’s cooperation, the SEC’s pursuit of sanctions raises questions about the investigation’s outcome.

The regulatory body seeks an order requiring Musk to justify his actions and demonstrate why he should not be found in contempt of court.

Infrastructure-intensive industries are undergoing massive transformations to meet the need for digital innovation. New technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are being applied to industries that haven’t evolved in years.

Infrastructure-intensive sectors are also moving towards decentralized models. As a result, decentralized physical infrastructure, or DePINs, are quickly gaining traction.

According to a new report from Moody’s Ratings, “How DePINs could build the future of physical infrastructure one token at a time,” the DePIN market has the potential to reach $3.3 trillion by 2030. Findings show that this market was valued at $2.2 trillion last year.


DePIN For The Auto Industry Explained
While the concept behind DePIN may seem complex, billion-dollar industries, like the automotive sector, are beginning to demonstrate the transformative nature of these models.

Early use cases show how car owners can own and leverage their data while earning incentives for sharing personal information.


For example, Dimo is a DePIN network built to improve the car ownership experience. Rob Solomon, Co-Founder of Dimo, told Cryptonews that Dimo seeks to make every car on the planet smart and programmable by putting vehicles on-chain.

“Dimo works by giving vehicles an on-chain identity,” Solomon said. “Users mint their vehicle on-chain to create a digital twin of the car. We then connect the digital car to the Dimo platform via a vehicle ID.”


Source: Dimo
Solomon explained that the data generated from a user’s car is recorded off-chain. This includes the speed, location, and other information generated over time.

Users are then able to share that data with Dimo if they choose to do so, earning tokens as an incentive.

“The Dimo token is live, and anyone who connects their car automatically earns Dimo tokens weekly as a baseline reward,” Solomon said. “Users also have the choice to share their data to earn additional rewards that go directly to the Dimo wallet.”

According to the Dimo protocol dashboard, 112,311 cars are connected to Dimo, with over 36,000 vehicle ID holders.

User Data Streamlines The Auto Industry
While drivers can earn passive income by connecting their cars to Dimo, the data generated can streamline traditional processes within the auto industry.

Solomon believes that Dimo will enable new types of use cases that companies can build out over time.

For example, he mentioned that car insurance agencies can partner with Dimo to access data from the platform.

“Insurance companies can’t access important data from drivers and their vehicles, so they are looking for a better way to connect with users. They see Dimo as a way to do this,” he said.

Another use case Solomon believes will soon be possible is having cars connect directly to parking garages.

“Once a vehicle enters a garage, a payment will already be secured, and the car will know exactly where to park,” he noted.

Car Data Helps With Mapping Accuracy
Another interesting automotive DePIN use case is being enabled by a street-level mapping project called Hivemapper Network.

Ariel Seidman, Co-founder of Hivemapper Network and the CEO of the Bee Maps brand, told Cryptonews that Hivemapper contributors could help build digital maps by collecting high-quality, street-level imagery with dashcams connected to their vehicles.

“Traditional mapping solutions often struggle with keeping data current, especially in rapidly changing urban areas or less accessible regions,” Seidman said. “Hivemapper’s decentralized approach allows for real-time updates and ensures that map data is both fresh and reflective of on-the-ground realities.”

Hivemapper seeks to solve the problem of digital mapping accuracy. According to recent statistics, drivers using Google Maps across 56 journeys, covering 18 miles in 32 minutes, found that driving time accuracy was 23% and journey length accuracy was 38% correct.

It was also noted that every month, over a billion people access Google Maps to find destinations and determine optimal routes.

“By enabling individuals and fleets to contribute to the map, Hivemapper ensures a more comprehensive coverage that can cater to the diverse needs of users across a region,” Seidman noted.

This is especially important as demand for real-time, accurate map data is growing. This is being driven by the rise of autonomous vehicles, advanced logistics, and emerging technologies that depend on precise geospatial information.

Although Hivemapper is taking a new approach to mapping systems, the network already contains 10 million miles of map coverage.

According to Seidman, Hivemapper has added coverage five times faster than Google Street View.


“The network already offers unique coverage for more than 26% of the world’s roads, with the strongest coverage across North America, Europe, South Korea, and Japan,” he said.

Users Are Incentivized To Share Data
Seidman added that map contributors are rewarded with a digital token called “HONEY,” which can be redeemed in return for map data.

“This model allows the economic benefits of the global mapping network to be shared with the people who build the map,” he said.

Like other DePIN models, The Hivemapper Network is designed to be entirely decentralized. Siedman believes that this helps the Hivemapper Network remain fair and open.

“Along with engaged members of the community, the Hivemapper Foundation will help maintain the decentralized mapping network and support an open-source ecosystem, including releasing source code and materials for hardware and software projects,” he remarked.

Challenges With Current DePIN Models
While DePINs may be a killer use case for blockchain, a number of challenges remain that will likely hinder its mainstream adoption across various industries.

According to Moody’s Ratings report on DePIN, regulatory compliance is among one these challenges.

“Companies in infrastructure-intensive sectors operate under stringent rules that govern core operations, such as spectrum use, infrastructure deployment and data protection that vary widely across jurisdictions,” the report noted. “A decentralized infrastructure model would need to be able to navigate these complex landscapes to ensure compliance while still maintaining maximum operational flexibility and scalability.”


Source: Moody’s Ratings Report
Unfortunately, DePIN regulations will likely take time to develop. Josh Benaron, Founder and CEO of the layer-1 data chain Irys, told Cryptonews that traditional physical infrastructure players view DePIN with skepticism and a lack of trust.

“This is due to its decentralized nature,” Benaron said. “There is also no established process to implement DePIN with existing infrastructures, making it difficult for physical infrastructure companies to integrate this technology.”

Benaron explained that the DePIN sector needs to develop a seamless way to enhance interoperability while building a tool to boost transparency and efficiency that caters to all types of users in order to remove these adoption barriers.

Additionally, Moody’s Ratings report noted that scalability and sustainability remain critical concerns.

“Establishing and maintaining decentralized physical infrastructure in sectors such as telecom, particularly in remote or underserved areas, will likely require substantial financial investments and technical expertise,” the report said.

Ensuring robust connectivity and service reliability across decentralized networks further complicates infrastructure management.

DePIN Models Will Advance
Despite challenges, Benaron pointed out that within the last year, DePIN protocols have witnessed rapid growth across every major blockchain.

“With the increasing demand for data privacy and safety in our everyday lives, there is a greater need for decentralized data solutions,” he said. “Ongoing blockchain innovations are expected to bring more efficient and scalable DePIN projects that will drive real-world usability and attract more investments in this sector.”

Given this, Benaronn believes DePIN use cases will expand beyond the crypto industry, impacting major transportation, telecommunications, and AI companies.
Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) has raised $14.1 million in its presale as Pepe-themed coins surged on Friday.

From $13.8 million on Thursday, Pepe, with its own blockchain, attracted an additional $300,000 in 24 hours, bringing its total funding to the current amount.

Much of the new influx of capital came from renewed bullish interest in the crypto industry following the Fed’s surprising 50 basis point rate cut, which lifted digital asset prices since Wednesday.

In addition, Pepe Unchained has announced developer grants for builders looking to expand its L2 ecosystem, drawing more investors to its platform and causing its predecessor, Pepe ($PEPE), to look worryingly over its shoulder.

Pepe Unchained’s native token, $PEPU, is currently priced at $0.00981 until the next funding round starts in less than 19 hours, at which point the presale token price will be set at $0.00982.

Pepe-themed coins are experiencing significant gains, but $PEPU has outperformed them with even greater capital funding
Meme coins are back in vogue, cruising past the $40 billion market cap and currently shining at $42.63 billion.


Trading volumes have surged by 5.11% in the past 24 hours, reaching an impressive $5.57 billion.

Among the hottest tokens grabbing investor attention are the popular Pepe-themed coins. PeiPei ($PEIPEI) leads the pack, which has jumped 37.49% overnight and a remarkable 58% over the last seven days.

PeiPei (ETH) price today, PEIPEI to USD live price, marketcap and chart | CoinMarketCap

Following closely is PepeCoin ($PEPECOIN), which soared 10.11% in just one day and climbed 43% in one week. The third-most valuable meme coin, $PEPE, has seen a solid 5.62% bump since Thursday.

While these Pepe-themed meme coins have fared well lately, the ultimate version of Pepe, $PEPU, has outdone all of them by breaking yet another presale milestone, earning it the title of the top token presale in 2024.

Since its launch just three months ago, investors have quickly recognized how the project plans to address the quirks of Pepe ownership, which explains the substantial capital it has raised.

The solution is a proprietary blockchain designed to offer speeds 100 times faster than Ethereum at a fraction of the gas costs, something no other Pepe-themed tokens provide.

So, while Pepe tokens enjoy their moment in the spotlight, $PEPU is patiently waiting in the wings, ready to be unleashed.

Pepe Unchained’s developer grant
In preparation for the launch of its Layer 2 chain, Pepe Unchained has introduced “Pepe Frens With Benefits,” an initiative to award grants to developers creating projects on its new chain.

Developers are encouraged to build projects, submit grant applications, and await the Pepe Council’s vote. They will receive the grant if selected, with applications opening in Q4 2024.


Once developers begin creating powerful and innovative dApps or new tokens with a distinct Pepe flair – like a Pepe version of top Shiba Inu tokens or perhaps even bring Brett over – and experience the advantages of a faster, cheaper, and equally secure blockchain, it’s game over for all other Pepe tokens.

There’s just no beating $PEPU at that point, and the crypto world might as well crown $PEPU now as the new top Pepe, ready to take $PEPE’s spot on the meme coin leaderboard.

FOMO is kicking in as $15 million is within reach in a few days
The $15 million funding milestone, once seeming distant, is now just days away, with $PEPU purchases continuing to roll in as the week progresses.

It’s not far-fetched to predict that $15 million will be surpassed early next week, with the next target clearly set at $16 million.


Pepe Unchained is making its mark, and if you haven’t yet recognized this opportunity or positioned yourself accordingly, don’t miss out – this could be your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to catch a crypto gem.

To join the presale, visit the project’s official website, connect your wallet, and purchase $PEPU using ETH, USDT, or BNB. Credit card payments are also accepted.

Pepe Unchaiend’s smart contract is fully audited by Coinsult and SolidProof and verifies that zero critical issues were identified in its code.
Popular Solana meme coin DogWifHat ($WIF) is the best performing among the big five doge-themed meme coins this week with a blistering 18% advance on its price this time last Friday.

The $1.8 billion market cap token, which is currently the fourth largest meme coin in the world, added 3.4% in the last 24 hours and now changes hands at around $1.80.

By contrast, sector leader and original meme coin Dogecoin ($DOGE)—by far the largest meme coin with a market cap of $15.4 billion—only added 0.3% to its price both in the last 24 hours and in the last seen days.

DogWifHat ($WIF) Price Analysis
In general, crypto has been rallying since Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points (0.5%) after two years of eleven consecutive hikes, which took US interest rates to their highest level in two decades.

This means borrowing costs are coming down, a factor that will shift investors to more risk-on positions like crypto.

The news helped push the price of market leader Bitcoin ($BTC) up 9.3% from seven days ago as it trades at $63,420.


DogWifHat’s home chain Solana, represented by the $SOL token, grew 13% over the week and trades at $149.

Over on DogWifHat’s price chart we can see $WIF trading relatively conservatively following the August 5th crypto and stocks crash when spooked investors dumped their riskier assets.

Since then, the token has bounced in a narrow margin between $1.40 and $1.95. It looks set to continue that way with a falling relative strength index (RSI) of 50 indicating steady selling momentum.


Going into the weekend, this will mean DogWifHat’s rally is likely to cool off and hold steady until Monday.


Has The Fed Ushered The Return of Alt-Season? Memebet Casino Investors Think So
Now that the Federal Reserve is cutting rates, investors will likely be shifting into more risk-on positions for better rewards.

For those who don’t want to invest in meme coins for the potential of blistering returns, presales offers the opportunity to buy into crypto projects at their very launch. This makes them potentially more profitable than DogWifHat or Dogecoin.

Crypto’s $45.7 billion meme coin sector, which grew 4.6% in the last 24 hours, is one sector that is brimming with promise.

While meme coins may have started as a parody, they are rapidly finding longevity by offering new value and utility to holders.

One new project, called Memebet, has launched the first online casino where players use meme coins.

The presale launched this week and the project’s native $MEMEBET token received over $200,000 in investments in just two days.

With online gambling primed to explode from a $100 billion industry in 2024 to $130 billion within the next five years, there’s little that the Federal Reserve’s policies could do to impede the growth of platforms like Memebet.


$MEMEBET tokens unlock a range of benefits for players, including airdrop rewards, special VIP degen bonuses, and access to the upcoming Memebet Casino Lootboxes, featuring real-world prizes and casino bonuses.

The project has just launched a 400 million $MEMEBET airdrop.

To join it, simply buy some tokens, wait for the launch of the casino (before the end of the presale), and begin gaming and betting to secure rewards.
Elon Musk is under scrutiny as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moves to impose sanctions following his failure to attend a court-ordered deposition related to his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter.

The regulatory body announced on Friday its intention to seek sanctions against Musk after he canceled his scheduled testimony just three hours before it was set to take place on September 10, Reuters reported.

The SEC’s filing in a San Francisco federal court stated that it would request an order demanding Musk explain why he should not be held in civil contempt for failing to appear.

Musk’s Last-Minute Decision to Skip Violates Court Order
The agency argues that Musk’s last-minute decision to skip the deposition was in violation of a May 31 court order compelling his testimony.

On the day of the missed testimony, Musk, who leads Tesla and SpaceX, was at Florida’s Cape Canaveral to oversee the launch of SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn mission.

Despite his role as SpaceX’s chief technical officer, the SEC maintains that Musk would have been aware of the planned launch well in advance, given the company’s internal discussions two days prior.


The regulator’s lawyer, Robin Andrews, accused Musk of engaging in “gamesmanship” and urged the court to put a stop to such tactics.

“Musk’s excuse itself smacks of gamesmanship,” Andrews wrote in the filing. “The court must make clear that Musk’s delay tactics must cease.”

Alex Spiro, Musk’s attorney, labeled the SEC’s move as “drastic” and unnecessary.

He argued that Musk’s presence was crucial for the safety of the astronauts involved in the mission and that the testimony has already been rescheduled for October 3.

Spiro contended that the failure to testify was due to an “emergency” and there is no indication it would happen again.

The SEC has refrained from commenting further on the case but noted in its filing that nothing guarantees Musk will appear for the rescheduled testimony on October 3.

SEC Investigates Musk
The investigation centers on whether Musk violated securities laws by not disclosing his initial accumulation of Twitter stock in early 2022 in a timely manner.

According to securities regulations, investors must disclose once they own 5% of a public company.

Musk delayed revealing his 9.2% stake in Twitter, leading to accusations of misleading shareholders.

He has since argued that the delay was a misunderstanding of the disclosure requirements, calling it a “mistake.”

This is not the first time Musk has clashed with the SEC.

In 2018, he settled a lawsuit over tweets about taking Tesla private, agreeing to pay a $20 million fine and relinquishing his role as Tesla’s chairman.

Meanwhile, the SEC has been facing growing criticism due to its “regulation-by-enforcement” approach to the crypto industry.

Critics argue that the SEC has failed to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, opting instead to pursue legal action against key industry players.

As reported, a coalition of seven U.S. states has come together to challenge the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulation of cryptocurrency.

Trump’s Bitcoin Stunt Boosts Crypto Appeal with Pro-Crypto Stance
Former President Donald Trump made headlines on Free Cheeseburger Day by conducting a public Bitcoin transaction at PubKey, a Bitcoin-themed bar in New York City.


During the event, Trump voiced support for a pro-crypto regulatory environment and urged his supporters to vote in November.

Although he once called Bitcoin a “scam,” Trump has now embraced cryptocurrency, raising $25 million in donations, mostly in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Tests Key Resistance at $63,000 Amid Bullish Run
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) trades around $63,000 after hitting an intraday high of $63,546. The price is currently facing resistance near $63,800, which aligns with the upper boundary of the ascending channel.

Immediate resistance stands at $64,154, with further targets at $65,536 and $67,329.

On the downside, immediate support is seen at $62,357, followed by $60,777, where the upward trendline also offers psychological support around $60,000.

The 50-day EMA, positioned at $60,727, is another key technical indicator supporting the current bullish momentum.


The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 61.72, having retreated from overbought levels, suggesting a potential bearish correction.

A drop below $62,000 could trigger further downside toward $60,600. However, if BTC holds above $62,000, a bullish rally is likely to continue.

The crypto community is closely watching how the upcoming election impact the industry.

While former President Donald Trump has labeled himself the “crypto president,” actively advocating for the sector, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has maintained a more restrained stance since joining the race.

According to Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets Research, and Nathan Frankovitz, a digital asset investment analyst at the firm, both a Harris and a Trump administration could be bullish for Bitcoin, but the broader digital asset market might experience divergent outcomes under their leadership.

Harris Presidency Might be Better for Prices
VanEck outlined a scenario in which a Harris presidency could see the retention of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, known for his stringent stance on cryptocurrency regulation.

This, coupled with Harris aligning her financial policies with the more regulatory-focused wing of the Democratic party, represented by Senator Elizabeth Warren, could create a challenging environment for institutional adoption of digital assets.

Such a regulatory climate could stifle innovation and growth within the sector, posing challenges to broader crypto market development.


However, there is a silver lining for Bitcoin enthusiasts.

VanEck suggested that a Harris presidency might, paradoxically, be more beneficial for Bitcoin than a Trump administration.

The firm argued that the structural issues potentially exacerbated under Harris, such as increased fiscal spending and regulatory tightening, could drive more investors to Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation.

This could enhance Bitcoin’s appeal and competitiveness over other digital assets.

On the other hand, VanEck’s analysis suggested that the crypto industry as a whole could benefit more from a second Trump term.

A Trump presidency would likely bring more deregulation and business-friendly policies, which could particularly favor crypto entrepreneurs.

Under such an administration, the firm believes the crypto ecosystem would experience less regulatory scrutiny, providing a more conducive environment for growth and innovation.

Bernstein Expects Bitcoin to Surge if Trump Wins
Not everyone shares this view, though.

A report from Bernstein projects a rise in Bitcoin’s price, potentially reaching between $80,000 and $90,000, if Trump wins the election.

Conversely, they predict a downturn, with Bitcoin possibly testing the $30,000 to $40,000 range, should Harris emerge victorious.

Despite differing opinions on the candidates, the broader macroeconomic trend appears to favor Bitcoin regardless of who wins.

VanEck notes that the U.S. will likely continue on a path of growing fiscal deficits and rising national debt, leading to a weaker dollar.

Historically, such conditions have been favorable for Bitcoin, which many investors view as a store of value and hedge against economic instability.

Meanwhile, investment Bank Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick has said Bitcoin is expected to end the year at new all-time highs regardless of who wins the US election.

Kendrick suggested that Bitcoin could reach new all-time highs by the end of 2024 due to “positive drivers dominating regardless of the election outcome.”

“I think Bitcoin ends the year higher, at new all-time highs, no matter who wins the U.S. election, with a Trump win taking it to $125,000 and $75,000 if it’s Harris.”
Global financial giants Franklin Templeton and Citigroup are turning to Solana for next-gen financial services, highlighting the blockchain’s growing prominence in decentralized finance (DeFi).

Franklin Templeton, managing over $1.4 trillion in assets, has announced plans to launch a mutual fund natively on Solana, while Citigroup is exploring the blockchain’s potential for smart contracts and cross-border payments.


These announcements, made at the Solana Breakpoint 2024 event in Singapore, underline the increasing interest from traditional financial (TradFi) institutions in Solana’s scalability and low transaction costs, making it an ideal blockchain for large-scale operations.

Franklin Templeton’s Blockchain Strategy
Franklin Templeton’s decision to launch a mutual fund on Solana demonstrates the firm’s commitment to integrating blockchain technology for operational efficiency.

Mike Reed, partnership development lead at Franklin Templeton, highlighted that Solana’s transactional capacity and cost efficiency were critical factors.


He stated, “Solana offers the scalability we need to handle large volumes of ledger entries for a mutual fund, making it the right choice for this initiative.”

The mutual fund will operate natively on Solana, further cementing Franklin Templeton’s position as a blockchain leader.

The asset manager already oversees Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and sees Solana as crucial to the future of decentralized finance.

Citibank Eyes Cross-Border Payments
Citigroup also sees Solana’s potential for cross-border money transfers and smart contract deployment. Having already tested blockchain applications using Avalanche, Citibank views Solana as a future driver of seamless financial transactions.

Both Franklin Templeton and Citibank’s interest in Solana highlights a broader trend of major financial institutions exploring blockchain to streamline operations and reduce costs.

Solana Price Outlook; $146.50 Supports
Solana is consolidating after reaching an intraday high of $149.46, facing resistance near $149.50. Immediate resistance levels lie at $152.50 and $157.21, aligned with key Fibonacci retracement levels.


On the downside, support can be found at $146.50, followed by $142.80 and stronger support at $139.80, where the 50-day EMA ($138.89) provides additional protection.


The RSI is at 66, nearing overbought conditions, signalling potential consolidation before another push higher.

Key Insights:

Resistance: Immediate resistance at $149.50, with higher targets at $152.50 and $157.21.
Support: Immediate support at $146.50, with the 50-day EMA at $138.80 providing solid backup.
RSI: Nearing overbought conditions at 66.47, signalling possible short-term consolidation.
As institutional adoption grows, Solana’s outlook remains strong, with further price increases expected if momentum continues.

The meme coin market has particularly exploded in 2024. Coins like dogwifhat have pumped considerably.

But many of these coins are driven by hype. They even fall short when it comes to giving their communities real decision-making power. That’s where FLOCKERZ comes in.

FLOCKERZ is the first meme coin built as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with true community-led governance. Instead of relying on a central team, FLOCKERZ hands control to its community, “The Flock.” This means that everyone involved has a say in shaping the project’s future.

Let’s dive into what makes FLOCKERZ different and why it’s gaining attention.

A True DAO: Community Makes the Decisions
Most meme coins, including dogwifhat (WIF), are developed by a small group of individuals or teams. These teams make key decisions about the project’s direction.

This is done often without consulting the broader community. Even though this can lead to fast-paced development, it leaves many investors feeling like they have no real influence.


By creating a DAO that gives the community authority, FLOCKERZ turns that concept. The Flock, or the holders of the $FLOCK token, make decisions in this system via Flocktopia. Every member gets a say in matters such as adding new features, choosing token burning, and entering new markets.

To take part in decision-making, you need to hold $FLOCK tokens. Proposals are submitted to the community for votes. These can include decisions on key features, project direction, marketing, or development.

Every time a $FLOCK holder participates in voting, they earn tokens through FLOCKERZ’s Vote-to-Earn platform. This ensures that members not only shape the project but are also rewarded for their contributions.

This fully decentralized model ensures that no single entity controls the project. Instead, power is distributed among the community, making FLOCKERZ a truly democratic meme coin.


FLOCKERZ’s Roadmap
The decentralized model of FLOCKERZ is the foundation of the project’s growth. FLOCKERZ has a clear roadmap for the future, and every step is shaped by the input of its community.

Key milestones include:

Nest Security Audit: Before launching, the project underwent a comprehensive security audit to ensure that the $FLOCK token and its smart contracts are secure.
Global Expansion: The next phase of FLOCKERZ’s roadmap involves expanding its reach through marketing efforts. As the community grows, so will the range of proposals, allowing FLOCKERZ to scale.
Token Listings: The project is preparing to list $FLOCK on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. This will increase liquidity and give more users access to the token.
Continuous Feature Development: As FLOCKERZ grows, the community will continue to make decisions on new features and directions for the project. From staking to additional governance mechanisms, every new feature will be a product of collective decision-making.
This roadmap ensures that FLOCKERZ will continue to grow based on the needs of its community. Unlike many meme coins that fizzle out after their initial hype, FLOCKERZ is designed to thrive through ongoing, community-driven development.

Check out their running presale that has raised over $215,000. FLOCK tokens can be bought with ETH, USDT, BNB or card. Connect the mentioned wallet on the website, enter the number of tokens, and complete the purchase.

Note that FLOCKERZ has a total token supply of 150 billion $FLOCK tokens. Once you invest in presale, you can also stake your tokens with over 10 million $FLOCK tokens already staked.

The price of the token is likely to increase from its current value of $0.005522 as the presale progresses to the next stages.

Doge2014 is a hot new crypto celebrating the decade-old legacy of Dogecoin. In the ongoing presale, investors can secure Doge2014 coins for prices similar to Dogecoin’s ten years ago.

Presale investors are not just eligible for discounted token prices, but also attractive bonuses and free entry into a Dogecoin airdrop. It is one of the best nostalgic meme coins of all time.

Staking Rewards Above 1000%!
Currently, Doge2014 is selling for $0.000318 in its sizzling hot presale that is on its way to the $500K milestone. The presale price increases with each new stage, giving a sharp edge to early backers.

Attractive staking rewards also await them.


In other words, presale investors can put their tokens to work right away. They can earn passive income on their presale tokens as they wait for value appreciation. With the staking APY above 1000%, the opportunity is too good to pass.

Staking is a great way for projects to build a community of long-term investors. The win-win situation generates passive income for investors, while helping the project maintain sustainable growth.


For meme coins, in particular, staking is a great way to steer clear of pump-and-dump schemes.

Up to 75% Bonus for Top Buyers, Free Entry to Dogecoin Airdrop
Presale investors are eligible for attractive bonuses in the ongoing presale. The bonus is determined by the number of tokens purchased. Bonus tokens help drop your cost to as low as $0.00018. Launch Price is $0.000348.


The presale also offers an excellent opportunity to score free DOGE. The entry is exclusive to Doge2014 VIPs, who have invested $1000 or more in the presale.

They can claim a portion of the airdrop pool. The number of tokens makes a difference here too – the more you invest, the bigger the rewards.

The airdrop begins after the presale hits the $500,000 goal. At the time of this writing, the presale number stood above $485,000. Follow Doge2014 on Twitter and Telegram for the latest presale updates.

Here is how the airdrop will be distributed over time:

$500,000 – $4,999,999 Raised: 2% of the total will be used to buy Dogecoin.
$5,000,000 – $7,999,999 Raised: 3% of the total will be used to buy Dogecoin.
$8,000,000 – $9,999,999 Raised: 4% of the total will be used to buy Dogecoin.
$10,000,000+ Raised: 5% of the total will be used to buy Dogecoin.
The $DOGE airdrop pool will be distributed to VIPs according to their investment after the presale sell-out. For investors who missed out on Dogecoin when it was selling for ridiculously cheap prices, the ongoing Doge2014 presale is an excellent opportunity.


Yes, Doge2014 gets free DOGE to VIPs. But its true allure lies in its potential journey ahead, capitalizing on DOGE nostalgia.

The Right Time to Buy Doge2014 is Now
With each new stage, the Doge2014 presale price undergoes a small increase. It is structured to promote early investments.

To join the presale, all you need is a compatible crypto wallet loaded with ETH or USDT. If you don’t have crypto deposits, no problem. The platform supports purchases using bank cards. But the crypto wallet is mandatory since that’s where you will store your purchased tokens.

Doge2014 supports popular crypto wallets like Best Wallet, Metamask, Wallet Connect, and Coinbase Wallet.

Once you have connected your wallet to the website, enter the amount of DOGE2014 you wish to purchase and follow the instructions to authorize the transaction.


The presale tokens will be credited to your wallet once claiming is activated. Don’t forget to opt for the ‘Buy and Stake’ option if you would like to earn passive income during the holding period.

The bonus calculator on the website helps you curate your purchase for the maximum benefits. For free entry to the Doge2014 airdrop, make sure your purchase fulfills the VIP slab.
Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and Hollywood donors played a pivotal role in boosting Vice President Kamala Harris’ fundraising efforts in August.

The surge has provided the Democrats with a significant financial edge over former President Donald Trump, as they head into the most costly phase of the presidential election, according to a recent report by Fortune.

Harris’ campaign managed to raise an impressive $361 million in August, bringing the Democratic party’s total cash on hand to $404 million.

In contrast, Trump’s campaign raised $130 million during the same period, spending $32 million more than what was brought in due to a costly advertising blitz aimed at countering Harris’ momentum.

Harris Establishes Lead in Financial Race
Trump’s primary super political action committee (PAC), Make America Great Again Inc., also saw its reserves dwindle.

Despite the close polling, Harris has established a clear lead in the financial race.


The Vice President’s fundraising efforts included numerous high-profile events in places like San Francisco and the Hamptons, tapping into California’s deep-pocketed donor base.

Her campaign and allied super PAC, Future Forward PAC, have secured $421 million in paid media for the final months leading to Election Day, nearly doubling the $216 million booked by Trump and MAGA Inc.

The finance industry has been a significant source of support for Harris.

High-profile contributors include Bruce Karsh of Oaktree Capital Management, Robert Stavis from Bessemer Venture Partners, and I Squared Capital’s co-founder Sadek Wahba.

Other notable donors include Janice Savin Williams from Siebert Williams Shanke, legendary oil trader Andy Hall, and E. John Rosenwald, a vice chair at JPMorgan Chase.

Even Hollywood has thrown its weight behind Harris, with celebrities like Scarlett Johansson, Frances McDormand, and Carol Burnett contributing to her campaign.

In addition to traditional fundraising, Harris has seen significant support from Future Forward PAC, which raised $36 million in August, bolstered by $3 million donations from Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and the Pacific Environmental Coalition, a nonprofit led by venture capitalist Matt Cohler.

Notably, Ripple Labs co-founder Christian Larsen donated $1 million in XRP cryptocurrency, highlighting the growing intersection of digital assets and political financing.

Trump Sees New Sources of Support
On the other side, Donald Trump’s campaign has seen new sources of support, particularly from the crypto industry, a sector he has actively courted.

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, made his largest reported political contribution to date, giving $289,100 to the National Republican Congressional Committee.

Additionally, Musk has set up a super PAC to back Trump and House Republicans, but details of its donors will not be disclosed until next month.

Longtime Republican donors, including hedge fund manager Paul Singer, who previously stayed away from Trump, have now started contributing.

Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz, Interactive Brokers Group Chairman Thomas Peterffy, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner Edward Glazer were among the prominent donors supporting Trump and the GOP in August.

Other major contributions came from casino moguls Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta and billionaire Diane Hendricks, who gave $10 million to MAGA Inc.
Renowned financial author Robert Kiyosaki has again made headlines with his bold Bitcoin price prediction. Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, shared on social media that his friend Jim Rickards’ upcoming book MONEY GPT highlights the transformative role of AI in finance.

Most notably, Rickards predicts that Bitcoin could surge to $500,000 by 2025 and possibly reach $1 million by 2030.

This forecast aligns with Kiyosaki’s long-held view of Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty and a means of preserving wealth amidst a volatile financial landscape.


With the cryptocurrency market becoming increasingly attractive to institutional investors and advancements in blockchain technology, Kiyosaki’s $500K prediction for 2025 might not be as far-fetched as it seems.

However, reaching such price targets would require major shifts in market dynamics, including stronger adoption of Bitcoin as a digital store of value and a favorable regulatory environment.

Bitcoin Price Outlook: Support and Resistance Levels
As of today, Bitcoin is trading at $62,700, down around 0.50% over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has recently faced resistance at the $64,154 level, causing a slight pullback.


Bitcoin is now hovering near a key support level at $62,380, within an ascending channel that reflects its broader bullish trend.

Should the price break below this support, it could signal further downside. The next significant support level is $61,300.

Support levels: $62,381, $61,298, $60,660
Resistance levels: $64,154, $65,536, $67,329
The 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently at $61,298, provides robust support, maintaining Bitcoin’s bullish outlook. If Bitcoin holds above this EMA, it could preserve the current momentum, potentially pushing prices back toward resistance at $64,154.


RSI Indicator: Neutral with Potential for Correction
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin is at 53, indicating a neutral market stance. However, it has retraced from previous overbought levels, which suggests that Bitcoin could enter a brief consolidation or even a minor correction phase.

Should the RSI decline further, it might indicate increasing bearish pressure, signalling that Bitcoin could test lower support levels before any further upside movement.

For Bitcoin to maintain its bullish trend, it must hold above the critical support at $62,381. A break below this level could see the cryptocurrency retesting $61,298 or even lower at $60,660. Conversely, if Bitcoin can break above the immediate resistance at $64,154, it could aim for higher targets of $65,536 and $67,329.

Key Technical Takeaways:

Bitcoin’s immediate support stands at $62,381, with the 50-EMA at $61,298 offering additional backing.
Resistance is seen at $64,154, with further upside potential toward $65,536 and $67,329.
The RSI at 53 indicates a neutral outlook but warns of potential consolidation before further upside.
In conclusion, institutional interest and significant support from technical indicators have helped Bitcoin remain in a bullish trend.

However, traders should closely monitor support at $62,381 and monitor economic and regulatory developments that could further influence the cryptocurrency’s price trajectory.

As bold predictions from influential figures like Robert Kiyosaki gain traction, Bitcoin’s future could see dramatic price increases—potentially even reaching Kiyosaki’s anticipated $500K by 2025.

The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has investors on edge as the SEC contemplates a last-minute appeal, keeping the XRP price under pressure.

Former SEC attorneys Marc Fagel and James Farrell anticipate that the regulator will appeal the ruling in Ripple’s favour, as not doing so could harm its authority. With the appeal deadline fast approaching, the XRP community is left speculating on the outcome.

Attorney Fred Rispoli suggests that the SEC may wait until the final moments to announce its decision, adding to the growing tension. Ripple executives, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse, have denied any intent to settle, and a court stay order is holding the $125 million penalty in limbo.


The XRP market is closely watching the SEC’s next move, which could significantly impact the cryptocurrency’s price trajectory.

Key Technical Levels for XRP Price
XRP is trading at $0.591, reflecting a 1.05% increase over the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency holds above the critical 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $0.5815, indicating that the current uptrend remains intact.

Ripple Chart
Support Levels: Immediate support is located at $0.5765, aligned with the upward trendline. Should this level break, XRP may target further downside, with key support at $0.5626 and $0.5454.
Resistance Levels: On the upside, XRP faces resistance at $0.6137, followed by $0.6303 and $0.6483. A breakout above these levels could sustain the bullish trend, pushing XRP toward higher price targets.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54, signaling neutral market conditions. While the RSI suggests room for both upward and downward moves, a decline below 50 could indicate a potential bearish correction.

Ripple’s Legal Outlook and Impact on XRP Price
The potential SEC appeal has introduced uncertainty into XRP’s otherwise bullish outlook. A favourable ruling could propel the token, while a drawn-out legal battle may result in increased volatility. Investors should also monitor macroeconomic factors, such as regulatory shifts and market sentiment toward cryptocurrency.


Key Takeaways:

XRP’s 50-day EMA at $0.5815 offers robust support, maintaining the bullish trend.
Immediate resistance lies at $0.6137, with upside potential toward $0.6483 if broken.
RSI at 54.44 shows a neutral stance, leaving room for market movement in either direction.
With the SEC’s decision looming, investors should prepare for potential volatility in XRP’s price, depending on the outcome of the legal proceedings.

As it is quite common for such a marketplace to be quite volatile, there is no shortage of newer projects that attract the attention of investors or traders. To illustrate this point, two recent tokens that have been in the news are DOGS/DO, a meme coin on the Telegram Open Network, and Rexas Finance (RXS) designed to change the perception of RWA assets on the blockchain. Both tokens have launched successfully, however, speculation on their sustainability is another issue that still divides investors.

DOGS: A Meme Coin With a Meteoric Rise and Subsequent Dip
DOGS, being a new meme coin, experienced a tremendous launch on popular crypto exchange networks such as Binance. Its price was listed at $0.00054 and just hours after it got listed, this value appreciated by 150% to go beyond $0.0013.

The token’s value slumped to below a penny and a third, which was a clear indication that the initial investors were exiting to get their profits and the selling pressure was increasing. This dip most recently extended during a rise in uncertainties about Telegram’s future and commitment to the TON ecosphere in the long term.DOGS is rather projected to return more than usual rates but on a very small margin such that some analysts are projecting only a 2x return for two years. But considering how rapidly the crypto market is transforming, such rates of growth could fail to stir the interests of serious long-term market players.

Rexas Finance (RXS): Unlocking the Future of RWA Tokenization
In the search for investors and buyers of the DOGS tokens, which are enjoying the crowded market of meme coins, Rexas Finance (RXS) has quite a different focus. Rexas Finance was launched a little over a week later, on 8th September 2024, and seeks to bring asset tokenization on the blockchain. Real-world assets for example real estate nearly can be represented in the form of tokens on a blockchain for better reach to the international market. This global accessibility of the project will be one of the key factors in raising demand for RXS tokens, as the project presents opportunities that did not previously exist for investors. In just a matter of days, RXS had realized substantial interest, querying more than $800,000 during its presale.

RXS token will launch presale at $0.04 and according to investors, this is a good price considering that by 2027 the token will be worth $50 and even more. Economically, this translates to potential returns of more than 1,000x to the other investors who get into the project at an early stage. I would put RXS somewhere as one of the most promising long-term opportunities in the crypto market.


Long-Term Potential Comparison: DOGS vs. Rexas Finance (RXS)
DOGS, in the context of meme coins, is entirely dependent on hype and the support of the community. Although it had a good performance initially, the long-term prospects are quite low. The 2x increase expected for the next two years will be inadequate looking at other growth industries, and the constant dependency on the sentiments of the community concerning the token makes it beset with instability.

Rexas Finance, on the other hand, presents an entirely different picture when it comes to long-term storytelling abilities. Tackling real issues such as the access and the possibility of investing in RWAs, RXS is therefore a disruptor.

The fact that the project has successfully been able to raise over $800,000 during its presale speaks volumes of the confidence that investors have towards the project, and how realistic the $50 target for its valuation is by the year 2027 suggests the massive room that is still left for growth.

Conclusion: Rexas Finance Emerges as the Superior Long-Term Bet
Although DOGS captures the short-term interest with its explosive genesis and the rabid appetite that meme coins create, it is Rexas Finance (RXS) that is better positioned as a long-term hold. To serve the global market with the underlying assets, RXS addresses the important and emerging market. Its proposed target price of $50 by 2027 indicates that there is a rising graph of growth, very much higher than the minimal gains that are expected from DOGS.
The advent of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology has revolutionized the financial landscape, providing users with decentralized, secure, and transparent systems for transferring and storing wealth. However, with this innovation has come a new wave of challenges, particularly when it comes to security. As the value of digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and various altcoins has soared, so too has the frequency of hacking incidents, scams, and frauds. For many investors, losing cryptocurrency can feel like an irreversible loss, but blockchain recovery solutions are offering a glimmer of hope.

In this article, we will dive into the emerging field of blockchain recovery solutions, explore how companies like Sinereclaim are leading the charge, and discuss the importance of effective methods to recover stolen cryptocurrency.

The Rise of Digital Asset Theft
Cryptocurrency is often celebrated for its decentralized nature and the anonymity it provides to its users. However, these very features also make it an attractive target for cybercriminals. Over the past decade, billions of dollars worth of digital assets have been stolen, leaving victims feeling powerless. The losses are compounded by the fact that traditional law enforcement and financial institutions have limited abilities to track and recover stolen cryptocurrency.

There are several common methods used by hackers to steal digital assets, including:

Phishing attacks: Fraudulent schemes designed to steal personal information and access wallets.
Exchange hacks: Security vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency exchanges that allow attackers to steal funds.
Ransomware: Malicious software that locks down a user’s system until a ransom is paid, often in cryptocurrency.
Scams and fraudulent schemes: Fake investment platforms or shady Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) that trick users into handing over their funds.
With so many avenues for digital asset theft, it’s no surprise that blockchain recovery solutions are gaining significant attention.

What Are Blockchain Recovery Solutions?
Blockchain recovery solutions are specialized services and technologies aimed at helping individuals and organizations recover stolen cryptocurrency. These services combine forensic blockchain analysis, cyber-investigations, and legal strategies to track and potentially reclaim stolen digital assets. Although blockchain transactions are typically irreversible, these solutions leverage the transparent nature of blockchain technology to trace illicit activity and identify culprits.

Companies like Sinereclaim have emerged as leaders in this space, offering services designed to help victims recover their stolen assets.

Sinereclaim: Pioneers in Cryptocurrency Recovery
Sinereclaim is one of the most recognized names in the world of cryptocurrency recovery, offering innovative solutions for individuals and businesses that have fallen victim to scams, hacks, or lost access to their digital wallets. Their approach focuses on advanced blockchain forensic tools and techniques, coupled with a global network of partners in the legal and financial sectors.

Here’s a look at the core services offered by Sinereclaim:

Blockchain Forensic Analysis: Sinereclaim utilizes cutting-edge technology to analyze blockchain transactions and trace the movement of stolen funds. By tracking these transactions across the blockchain, they can identify patterns and find links to the individuals or groups responsible for the theft.
Wallet Recovery: If a user has lost access to their wallet due to forgotten passwords, corrupt software, or malfunctioning hardware, Sinereclaim provides wallet recovery services. They utilize advanced techniques to help recover private keys or access to compromised wallets.
Collaborations with Law Enforcement: Sinereclaim works closely with law enforcement agencies, legal professionals, and regulators across the globe. This collaboration enhances their ability to take legal action against those responsible for cybercrime and helps ensure that recovered assets are returned to their rightful owners.
Fraud and Scam Recovery: For those who have fallen victim to investment scams or fraudulent ICOs, Sinereclaim offers investigative services to uncover the perpetrators and assist in legal proceedings to recover the lost assets.
The Process of Recovering Stolen Cryptocurrency
Recovering stolen cryptocurrency is a complex and multi-step process that requires a deep understanding of blockchain technology, cybersecurity, and legal frameworks. Here’s an overview of the steps typically involved in recovering stolen cryptocurrency:

Incident Reporting: The first step for any victim is to report the incident. Sinereclaim encourage victims to act quickly by contacting their recovery team as soon as possible. Early reporting increases the chances of successful asset recovery.
Blockchain Forensic Analysis: After receiving a report, the recovery team begins by analyzing the blockchain transactions related to the theft. Using forensic tools, they trace the movement of funds from the victim’s wallet to the perpetrator’s wallet and beyond.
Identifying the Perpetrators: The transparent nature of blockchain makes it easier to trace stolen funds, even though the identities of wallet holders are pseudonymous. By following the transaction history, recovery experts can often link wallets to known exchanges, where KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols may provide additional identifying information.
Legal Action and Asset Seizure: Once the perpetrators are identified, legal teams can work with authorities to seize the stolen funds. This may involve freezing the assets stored in centralized exchanges or other wallets and initiating legal proceedings to return the funds to the victim.
Recovery and Restoration: After successful recovery, the stolen cryptocurrency is returned to the rightful owner. In some cases, victims may recover the entirety of their lost assets, while in other instances, they may only recover a portion, depending on the complexity of the case and the amount of time that has passed since the theft.
Challenges of Recovering Stolen Cryptocurrency
While blockchain recovery solutions offer a promising avenue for recovering stolen cryptocurrency, it’s important to note that the process is not always straightforward. Several challenges can impede recovery efforts, including:

Time Sensitivity: The longer a victim waits to report a theft, the more difficult it becomes to trace the stolen funds. Criminals often launder funds through multiple wallets or exchanges, making it harder to track their movements.
Jurisdictional Issues: Cryptocurrency operates across borders, which means that perpetrators can be located in countries with limited cooperation in financial crime investigations. This complicates the process of pursuing legal action.
Irreversible Transactions: One of the key features of blockchain technology is that transactions cannot be reversed. Once a transaction is confirmed, it is permanent. This makes it crucial to act quickly and employ advanced forensic tools to track stolen funds before they are laundered.
The Future of Blockchain Recovery Solutions
As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow, so will the demand for robust recovery solutions. Companies like Sinereclaim are pioneering the way forward by developing more advanced tools and techniques to track stolen assets and recover funds. Blockchain recovery solutions are becoming more sophisticated, leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and enhanced legal frameworks to improve the success rate of recovery operations.

In addition to technological advancements, collaboration between regulators, exchanges, law enforcement, and recovery firms will be essential. By working together, these entities can create a safer environment for cryptocurrency users and make it more difficult for criminals to exploit blockchain’s decentralized nature.

Conclusion
The rise of cryptocurrency has brought incredible innovation to the financial world, but it has also introduced new security challenges. The need to recover stolen cryptocurrency has never been more urgent, as more people and businesses fall victim to cybercrime. Fortunately, companies like Sinereclaim are leading the charge in offering comprehensive blockchain recovery solutions, providing hope for those who have lost digital assets.

While recovering stolen cryptocurrency is not always easy, the combination of forensic blockchain analysis, legal action, and collaboration with authorities is helping to revolutionize digital asset recovery. As blockchain technology evolves, so too will the tools and strategies used to protect and recover valuable assets. In the meantime, it’s essential for users to remain vigilant and act quickly if they fall victim to cryptocurrency theft, knowing that solutions like Sinereclaim are ready to assist.
In the race to dominate the Layer-1 blockchain space, Bitgert, Ethereum, and Cardano have emerged as key players, each bringing unique strengths and innovations. While Ethereum remains the industry leader with its extensive dApp ecosystem and robust intelligent contract capabilities, it faces growing competition due to scalability challenges and high gas fees. On the other hand, Cardano continues to build on its reputation for security and academic rigor, offering a more research-driven approach to blockchain development.

Bitgert, though newer, has been making significant strides by positioning itself as a cost-effective and high-performance alternative. Considering all these perks, let’s compare Bitgert, Ethereum, and Cardano in terms of performance and pricing.

Ethereum on Back Seat Against Bitgert
Ethereum’s dominance in the blockchain space is undeniable, but it faces growing competition from more scalable solutions like Bitgert and Cardano. The transition to Ethereum 2.0 has improved the platform’s scalability and reduced Ethereum’s energy consumption, but gas fees remain a concern for many users. Bitgert, on the other hand, offers a transaction speed of 100k TPS and a near-zero gas fee.

These advantages have led to multiple projects switching to Bitgert. If you follow their weekly newsletters, you know that they keep announcing new strategic partnerships with multiple protocols. Many innovative projects, such as PayBRISE, BRISE Exchange, RWA marketplace, Startup Studio, etc., are also on Bitgert.

Considering all these things against Ethereum, Bitgert’s $BRISE coin is gaining strong momentum. Even though Ethereum is a larger coin, Bitgert holds more advantages due to its mid-cap situation, growing market cap, and trading volumes at nearly 3-5%.

Cardano Vs. Bitgert, Who Wins the Race?
Cardano has long taken a systematic approach to its development, focusing on academic research and peer-reviewed updates. This has helped build a secure and sustainable blockchain, but it has also led to criticism for slower innovation compared to Ethereum and Bitgert. Cardano is, therefore, experiencing a decrease in the market cap and pricing even when the market is going higher now.

Cardano has another disadvantage compared to Bitgert’s $BRISE coin: the pricing of the tokens. Cardano is trading close to Bitgert’s target pricing, but its market cap is falling. In just a single day, its trading volume has also decreased by 18%. All of these facts led to the approval of Bitgert’s $BRISE coin as the token in which to invest.

Conclusion
Bitgert, Ethereum, and Cardano are layer 1 blockchains but have very different approaches to their domains. Bitgert’s $BRISE coin benefits from Bitgert’s overall functioning, while Ethereum and Cardano continue to struggle. So, the current pricing analysis of Bitgert’s $BRISE coin, Cardano, and Ethereum suggests that Bitgert’s $BRISE coin is more profitable for investors. Bitgert’s $BRISE coin is also prolific for small investors, while Ethereum and Cardano are not.
Rexas Finance has swiftly captured the attention of investors as Stage 2 of its presale sold out in less than a week, raising a total of $1,250,000. This strong investor interest marks a significant milestone in the project’s journey, highlighting the growing demand for the tokenization of real-world assets through blockchain technology. With Stage 3 now underway at a price of $0.05 per token, Rexas Finance continues to attract global attention, offering investors an opportunity for substantial returns, with early buyers potentially seeing a 4x increase upon launch.

The Power of Real-World Asset Tokenization
Rexas Finance is revolutionizing the real estate and asset market by offering a seamless platform for tokenizing real-world assets.

This approach opens up vast investment opportunities, allowing anyone to own a piece of the largest markets in the world, bypassing traditional barriers such as high costs and geographical limitations. The potential for growth in these sectors is immense, with Rexas Finance at the forefront of this financial shift.

The Rexas token builder simplifies the process for users, enabling anyone to tokenize their real-world assets, making these investments accessible to a broader audience. This development is transforming the way assets are bought, sold, and managed, breaking down entry barriers and democratizing access to markets that were once reserved for the wealthy or institutional investors.


Rexas Launchpad and Other Key Features
Beyond asset tokenization, Rexas Finance is also supporting entrepreneurs and developers through its launchpad, where users can raise funds for their tokenized projects. This feature adds another layer of utility to the platform, fostering innovation and creating new opportunities for project financing within the crypto market. Additionally, Rexas Estate offers a platform specifically for real estate investments, where users can buy, sell, and trade tokenized property assets efficiently.

The project also boasts a suite of other utilities, including the Rexas Quickmint Bot for swift asset tokenization, Rexas GenAI for enhanced project management, and Rexas AI Shield for security. Together, these tools ensure a comprehensive and secure ecosystem for investors, making it easier to navigate the tokenization process while offering protection and efficiency.

Rexas Finance Tokenomics and Presale Success
The RXS token operates on the ERC20 standard with a total supply of 1 billion tokens. The breakdown includes 42.5% allocated to presale, 22.5% for the staking pool, 15% for liquidity, and 10% for treasury, among other distributions. Notably, the project has chosen to bypass venture capital funding, opting instead for a public presale to allow more individuals to participate in this groundbreaking initiative.

Stage 1 of the presale sold out within days, raising $450,000, while Stage 2 followed suit, bringing the total to $1,250,000 raised so far. As Stage 3 progresses, the price has so far increased by 1.7x to $0.05 per token, reflecting the strong demand. Current investors stand to gain significantly, with projections of a 4x return upon launch.

Rexas Millionaire Giveaway: A Chance to Win Big
To further engage the community, Rexas Finance has launched a $1,000,000 giveaway, offering 20 lucky winners the chance to receive $50,000 USDT each. Participation is simple: entrants need to submit their ERC20 wallet address, complete all required actions, and refer friends for additional entries. This campaign not only rewards early adopters but also encourages wider participation in the project, boosting its visibility and user base.

Final Thoughts: Rexas Finance Leads the Asset Tokenization Revolution
The success of Rexas Finance’s presale is a clear indicator of the rising interest in asset tokenization and blockchain-based investments. With over $1.2 million raised and the presale in its third stage, Rexas Finance is proving to be a game-changer in how real-world assets are bought, sold, and managed. As the project moves forward, it continues to close the gap between traditional asset markets and blockchain technology, offering new opportunities for investors worldwide.
U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a surge in investor interest on Friday, recording $92 million in net inflows despite a market downturn.

The week also witnessed nearly $400 million in total inflows across these funds, according to data from SoSoValue.

Friday’s inflows were distributed among seven bitcoin ETFs, with Fidelity’s FBTC leading the pack, attracting $26.12 million.

More Funds See Inflows
The joint fund by Ark Invest and 21Shares, ARKB, followed closely with $21.99 million.

Bitwise’s BITB fund also recorded significant inflows, amounting to $15.08 million, while Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust saw $13.37 million.

Other bitcoin ETFs, including those from VanEck, Valkyrie, and Invesco, reported smaller but positive inflows.


Notably, there were no net outflows across all funds on Friday, and five funds, including BlackRock’s IBIT, reported zero activity.

The combined daily trading volume for U.S. bitcoin ETFs reached $980.59 million on Friday, with total net inflows since their January launch amounting to $17.69 billion.

The uptick in investment comes amid a challenging period for the broader crypto market, suggesting continued confidence in the long-term potential of bitcoin.

In related news, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing and trading of options for BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, which are expected to start trading on the Nasdaq soon.

Meanwhile, U.S. spot ether ETFs recorded a second consecutive day of positive inflows, totaling $2.87 million, primarily driven by Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust.

However, these funds have struggled overall.

Since their introduction in July, Ether ETFs have accumulated a total net outflow of $615.58 million, highlighting the challenges faced in maintaining investor confidence in this volatile market.

As reported, digital asset investment products saw a turnaround last week, with inflows reaching $436 million following a prolonged period of outflows totaling $1.2 billion.

The reversal was influenced by shifting market expectations, particularly the potential for a 50-basis-point interest rate cut.

Bitcoin Surges After Fed Rate Cut Decision
Last week, Bitcoin’s price surged to over $63,000 as investors reacted to the Federal Reserve’s rate cut announcement.

The Federal Open Market Committee’s decision to reduce rates by 50 basis points is seen as a move to stimulate economic growth amid ongoing concerns.

“In the short term, a 50 bps rate cut could signal to the market that the economy is slowing, hinting at underlying issues that may not yet be apparent,” Matt Mena, Crypto Research Strategist at 21Shares, said in a comment.

“This could unsettle both traditional and digital investors, potentially triggering initial volatility. However, over the long term, Bitcoin and other digital assets have historically thrived in low-interest-rate environments.”

Mena added that this move could signal a return of liquidity, sparking a risk-on sentiment and fueling a sharp Bitcoin rally as investors chase higher yields.

Aside from Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies also performed well
South Korean lawmakers claim their crypto wallets contain little more than “crypto dust,” as they continue to distance themselves from token ownership.

Per Sisa Journal, many notable crypto-holding lawmakers have sold their coins. This is likely due to ongoing crypto-related political scandals.

Crypto Dust Is All We Have Left, MPs Claim
Chief among these is the Coin Gate affair. The affair saw former lawmaker and crypto-related parliamentary commission member Kim Nam-guk accused of using insider information to trade coins.

Further allegations of crypto insider trading led lawmakers to accuse one another of secretly owning tokens ahead of parliamentary elections.


As a result, South Korean lawmakers and their families are now legally obliged to make crypto declarations.


So, rather than face public scrutiny about their crypto holdings, it appears that many lawmakers have simply liquidated their holdings.

And that means they have been left with wallets full of little more than crypto dust and modest amounts of airdrop-related coins.

What Is Crypto Dust?
Crypto “dust” refers to tiny quantities of cryptoassets that are typically too small to be traded.

This dust usually accumulates after crypto holders sell a maximum amount of coins, leaving behind tiny amounts that fall under crypto exchanges’ minimum trade limits.

Only 36 out of 300 elected National Assembly officials said they had any crypto holdings with a non-zero monetary value prior to April 10’s elections.

However, the percentage of crypto in total asset worth for all 300 lawmakers is a mere 0.01%. This, the media outlet explained, is an “absolutely insignificant amount.”

Moreover, many of those who declared coins appeared to have moved quickly to dispose of their cryptoassets.

The media outlet spoke to Chun Ha-ram of the New Reform Party, who reported that his wife had 11 crypto wallets holding tokens “worth a total of 22,000 won ($16.51).”

Chun Ha-ram, New Reform Party Lawmaker.

Six of these coins, Chun told the outlet, were airdrops to EOS coin holders, while three others were airdropped to XRP owners.

“[We] sold everything that could be sold. [We] are left with only small amounts of [dust] that cannot be traded.”

Chun Ha-ram, New Reform Party Lawmaker
Bitcoin Sell-off
The media outlet also gave the example of Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Jun-hyeok, who declared that he owned 114.2 million won ($85,700) worth of Bitcoin (BTC).

However, Kim Jun-hyeok has since claimed he “disposed of all” of his BTC “after declaring it.”

On the other side of the house, the People’s Power Party lawmaker Park Chung-kwon reported owning 58.8 million won ($44,128) worth of Solana (SOL) before the election.

But Park also said he had sold all of his SOL holdings in February this year.

Scandal Pushing Lawmakers Away from Crypto?
The media outlet added that records show that many lawmakers have also sold many of their holdings immediately after they received airdropped coins.


However, the records do make interesting reading for domestic crypto enthusiasts.

They indicate that certain lawmakers have been extremely active in the past on both the BTC and the altcoins markets.

One lawmaker declared owning crypto wallets for some 45 altcoins. But the same MP calculated these coins as having a worth of just over $580.

Kim Nam-guk, meanwhile, is set to face trial over ongoing allegations. Last month, prosecutors indicted the former Democratic Party MP on charges of using crypto to hide his assets.

Prosecutors think he used cryptoassets to hide almost $7.5 million worth of his wealth.

Argentina Tax Body Raids Bitcoin Mining ‘Hardware Smuggling Ring’
Argentina tax officials and naval security officers say they have thwarted a major Bitcoin mining hardware “smuggling” ring.

Per the media outlets La Capital Mar Del Plata and 0223, the Argentine Naval Prefecture (PNA) made multiple raids as part of a joint “mega-operation” with the national tax authority, the Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos (AFIP).

‘Bitcoin Mining Hardware’ Smugglers Thwarted?
The officials said that the ring smuggled “hundreds” of “high-end cell phones, video cards, and components for cryptocurrency mining” into the country.

They also claimed that the group allegedly used “crypto investments” to launder its profits and hide them from the authorities.

The state agencies published images of the money and items they seized. Among these photos was an image of customs officers standing in front of cardboard boxes bearing the Canaan logo.

Canaan is known in the crypto world as a major producer of ASIC Bitcoin (BTC) mining hardware.


Under Argentinian law, only permit-holding companies may import dedicated crypto mining rigs.

Officers also published photos of armed officers standing in front of what appears to be a clothing store.

This may suggest that the ring may have used a small store as a front – and a makeshift warehouse – for illicit crypto mining equipment storage.

Agents Seize Money and High-end Phones
Officers also said they seized “more than 30 million pesos” (worth over $31,000) and $19,000 in US dollars.

They added that they conducted multiple raids including in Mar del Plata, a major city on Argentina’s Atlantic coast.

Officers also raided properties in Bahía Blanca, another city, in the southwest of the Buenos Aires Province.

Officers said they had arrested four people, two men and two women, after conducting raids on six residential properties in the cities.

All four have been formally charged with smuggling and money laundering-related offenses, the agencies confirmed.

Company Acted as a Front for Smugglers?
PNA and AFIP officials said they also seized a motor vehicle, multiple electronic items, as well as other financial assets and items of clothing.

They added that they also seized documents they think are related to the case, “linked to a corporation” they think was at the heart of the operation.

In total, the PNA and AFIP said, the assets they seized had a market value of “over $624,000.”

In 2022, the AFIP swooped on illegal Bitcoin mining farms in a range of unusual locations, including a livestock farm and a luxury apartment block.

More recently, the tax agency has announced its intention to crack down on illegal Worldcoin (WLD) resellers.


The tax body is currently in the middle of trying to ensure that all crypto exchanges in the country abide by anti-money laundering protocols.

Under new regulations, all platforms active in the nation must ensure their clients abide by anti-money laundering protocols.

Australia crypto
Australia is set to introduce new regulations requiring the crypto industry to obtain financial services licenses under the Corporations Act.

On Monday, Australian Securities and Investments Commission commissioner Alan Kirkland said at an AFR Digital Assets Summit that many crypto-asset firms in Australia will need to be licensed. He stated that ASIC considers several crypto assets as financial products under existing laws.

ASIC’s regulatory framework focuses on “financial products,” which involve financial investments, risk management, or non-cash transactions. However, certain aspects of crypto don’t entirely align with this model. This creates uncertainty about whether specific crypto structures require licensing.

Kirkland confirmed to Cryptonews that ASIC will release new draft guidance soon, and plans to invite industry feedback on these updates.

“Millions of Australians now hold crypto-asset investments and ASIC wants to make sure they have access to important consumer protections provided by the current regulatory regime” he said.

Crypto Developers Bypass Licensing, Australia to Clarify Token Rules Amid Regulatory Concerns
Many crypto developers have not obtained Australian Financial Services Licenses (AFSLs), following legal advice. This decision is based on the belief that their investment products don’t fall under the purview of current laws, AFR reported.


To address that, ASIC plans to update guidance by November. This will clarify the classification and treatment of specific crypto tokens representing digital ownership rights and related products.

Further, Kirkland noted ASIC’s concern over potential consumer harm and market misconduct. He stated that licensing will help reduce risks, build consumer trust and protect market integrity.

ASIC Tightens Crypto Oversight
ASIC has intensified its enforcement efforts, signaling a heightened scrutiny over the crypto sector. The agency recently claimed that Kraken did not properly educate its Australian clients on the risks of margin trading, resulting in considerable financial losses for customers.

Further, in August, ASIC initiated legal action against ASX, accusing the market operator of mismanaging the blockchain-based CHESS replacement project.

Follow us on Google News.The US Vice President and the Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, has promised to encourage ‘innovative technologies’ such as cryptos.

She made her first public comment on digital assets, vowing to safeguard the industry’s interests.

Speaking at a Sunday fundraiser at Cipriani Wall Street in Manhattan, Harris pitched to assist crypto and AI, focusing on bolstering innovation.

A Bloomberg report read that Kamala Harris also promised to bring together labour, small business founders, innovators, and major companies.

“We will partner together to invest in America’s competitiveness, to invest in America’s future. We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets, while protecting our consumers and investors.”

Additionally, Kamala Harris provided more insights on handling regulations as a part of her vision for an ‘opportunity economy.’ She also emphasised creating a “safe business environment” with consistent rules.


“We will invest in semiconductors, clean energy and other industries of the future, and we will cut needless bureaucracy,” she added.

The Sunday fundraiser in Manhattan raised $27 million, the report noted. According to a campaign official, it was the largest single-event total since Kamala Harris has started campaigning.

Kamala Harris Crypto Support Widens
Early this month, crypto leaders organized a fundraiser to support Kamala Harris in a move to influence her crypto stance.

According to FiveThirtyEight data, Harris currently holds a narrow 2.9% lead over Trump in national polls. Since September, she has managed to secure the lead after President Joe Biden stepped down from the Presidential run.

The Sunday event, though heavily targeted at cutting high prices, her campaign also signalled Harris’ interests in crypto and in safeguarding the industry after several recent company collapses.

As reported earlier, hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci praised Kamala Harris’s approach to crypto policy. He said that Harris is on the right track on crypto, voicing optimism about her digital asset policies.
Decentralization is the norm in the crypto market.

Flockerz ($FLOCK) takes it to the next level with its refreshing vote-to-earn model. The meme coin rewards users for employing their decision-making skills and upholding the community-centric spirit of the project.

The feature doesn’t just incentivize token holders, but also instill a sense of shared purpose and belongingness in them.


The Flockerz Presale Pulls Crowds
Flockerz is hosting a presale of its native token $FLOCK now. It has surged past $225,000 as investors flock to grab the token before its exchange listings.

They are capitalizing on what could be the next big thing at the low prices.


Promising presale tokens allow investors to make strategic moves during downturns. The blend of low initial market caps and affordable entry points makes them ripe for substantial growth.


That doesn’t fully explain why the new altcoin is causing a stir in the market, however.

Flockerz, with its decentralized governance and vote-to-earn system, marks a new shift in the market. It gives investors a say in the project’s evolution, while presenting a unique earning mechanism.

The vote-to-earn model places decision-making power in the hands of the community.

Most crypto projects have failed to embrace the decentralized spirit of blockchain technology. Investors are often reduced to passive holders in these cases.

Flockerz allows the community to vote on key project decisions, establishing trust and nurturing long-term loyalty. In this case, investors become active participants who shape the future of the project.

Stake $FLOCK to Earn $FLOCK
In addition to its much-awaited vote-to-earn model, Flockerz presents a staking model. Investors can put their tokens to work right from the presale stage. Here, rewards are distributed over two years at a rate of 684.93 $FLOCK per Ethereum block.

25% of the total supply is dedicated to staking. As a passive income strategy that limits premature sell-offs, the substantial allocation supports the long-term growth of the project. It is key to the project’s longevity.

At the time of this writing, the staking APY stood above 15,000%.


Other aspects of the tokenomics model also show promise, fuelling the project’s sustainability.

For example, 20% is allocated for the presale and 25% is set aside for Flock Vault, underlining the community-centric principle of the project. Flock Vault is the project’s DAO treasury. 10% goes to liquidity and 20% is dedicated to marketing efforts.

Follow Flockerz on Telegram and Twitter for the latest project and presale developments.

What Lies Ahead
Flockerz has passed security audits from industry leaders like Coinsult and SolidProof. Audits are a critical step for building trust with the community, especially for young projects like Flockerz.

The presale of $FLOCK tokens is now live, offering early adopters heavy discounts and staking benefits. Soon after the presale, the token will make its way to major exchanges.

The Flockerz roadmap further instils confidence in the project’s journey ahead.

Flockerz plans to collaborate with major influencers in the crypto space to spread the word about the vote-to-earn model. Users will be able to actively participate in governance after the launch of the feature, fuelling community engagement.

“Never before has a meme coin community been in charge of every single major decision related to the project. And certainly, no meme coin DAO has rewarded its community for casting their votes on the blockchain. Flockerz ($FLOCK) holders are blazing a new trail in the space,” explains the website.

$FLOCK Presale is Now Live With Low Entry Points
The ongoing presale of $FLOCK offers low entry points into the project. It unlocks heavy discounts and staking rewards for early participants.


The staking APY goes down as more investors join the presale. The price, on the other hand, increases with each new stage of the presale.

While top meme coins are experiencing stagnation, investors are turning to smaller projects like Flockerz.

Younger meme coins offer fresh opportunities and high growth potential with low entry points. The success of meme coins like Popcat (SOL), Book of Meme (BOME), and Dogwifhat this year indicates the trend.

As one of the top small-cap crypto sensations of this season, Flockerz is a must-have on every crypto watchlist. Yes, the meme coin label centred around birds generates buzz for the project. But the vote-to-earn utility gives it staying power.
Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) face a “chicken-and-egg” problem, says the International Monetary Fund (IMF), where consumer adoption depends heavily on merchant participation, and vice versa.

The phrase “chicken-and-egg” is a metaphor used to describe a situation where two interdependent factors make it difficult to determine which one should come first.

In this case, the IMF highlights merchants may be reluctant to adopt CBDCs if consumers aren’t using them, while consumers may avoid CBDCs if merchants don’t accept them.

CBDCs are digital forms of a country’s national currency, issued and regulated by the central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are decentralized, CBDCs are fully backed by the central authority.

They aim to provide the same functions as physical currency but in digital form, offering a safe, regulated alternative to private digital currencies and payment systems.

Central banks around the world are exploring CBDCs to modernize payment systems, improve financial inclusion, and reduce reliance on cash.

Consumers Slow to Engage, Unsure About Widespread Acceptance
In the retail payments market, coordination challenges are common. Products can struggle if stakeholders hesitate to adopt them, fearing others won’t.


This dynamic applies to CBDCs, where both consumers and merchants might be slow to engage if they are unsure about widespread acceptance. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle of hesitation that central banks must address to foster adoption.

Central banks, as the primary drivers of the CBDC initiative, can play a proactive role in aligning expectations and creating a consensus among stakeholders, says the IMF.

Many central banks are exploring a two-tier model for CBDC distribution, where intermediaries such as commercial banks and payment service providers facilitate distribution and user adoption. This model helps by using existing financial infrastructures while ensuring that central banks maintain oversight, said the IMF.


Stakeholder engagement will play an important role in the adoption of CBDCs. The IMF advises central banks to adopt an iterative, inclusive approach to understanding the needs and concerns of merchants, intermediaries, and consumers. This involves not only addressing market challenges but also achieving a “product-market fit” for CBDCs.

In June, the IMF surveyed 19 countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, exploring the adoption and potential of CBDCs. The survey insights concluded that CBDCs could promote financial inclusion and enhance the efficiency of international remittances.

Out of those 19 countries surveyed, many are exploring CBDCs at its research stage. “Bahrain, Georgia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have moved to the more advanced “proof-of-concept” stage,” the insights read. “Kazakhstan is the most advanced after two pilot programs for the digital tenge.”
Two users of the prominent non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea have filed a class-action lawsuit in a U.S. federal court, accusing the platform of selling unregistered securities contracts.

The plaintiffs, Anthony Shnayderman and Itai Bronshtein, initiated the suit on September 19 in Florida, according to a report by Law.com.

The plaintiffs argue that certain NFTs purchased through OpenSea, including those from the once sought-after Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, have become worthless due to their purportedly illegal nature.

Plaintiffs Mention OpenSea’s Well Notice
Central to their case is OpenSea’s recent disclosure of receiving a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

A Wells notice is a formal notification indicating that the SEC has concluded an investigation and may bring an enforcement action against the recipient.


Shnayderman and Bronshtein contend that this notice implies OpenSea may be held accountable for facilitating the exchange of unregistered securities, which they believe includes certain NFTs sold on the platform.


The lawsuit draws parallels to previous SEC actions against NFT projects such as Stoner Cats 2 and Impact Theory, both of which were charged with selling unregistered securities.

The plaintiffs argue that the NFTs they purchased meet the criteria of an investment contract as defined by the Howey test, a legal standard used to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a security.

They claim that their investments in these NFTs were part of a common enterprise with the expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others.

Shnayderman and Bronshtein allege that OpenSea’s platform listings were misleading, causing them to purchase NFTs they describe as “worthless and unlawful unregistered securities.”

They also accuse OpenSea of breaching a user warranty by failing to adequately moderate its marketplace for such securities.

The plaintiffs further assert that OpenSea unjustly enriched itself by collecting fees and accepting payments from transactions it allegedly knew, or should have known, were linked to unregistered securities sales.

“Conjuring from thin air a purported class action lawsuit based on our disclosure of an SEC Wells notice won’t make the allegations in the complaint true,” a spokesperson for OpenSea said in a comment.

“We refute these allegations and look forward to defending against this baseless lawsuit.”

CryptoPunks NFT Sold at 80% Discount
In August, a CryptoPunk NFT sold for $23.2 million in 2022, resold at an 80% discount for 1,500 ETH, worth around $3.9 million.

The original owner, Deepak Thapliyal, who purchased the NFT for 8,000 ETH, bid farewell to the token on X (formerly Twitter).

The new buyer, VOMBATUS, later confirmed the purchase, equating the low price to getting a “free” token.

Meanwhile, there has been a trend of companies discontinuing their involvement in the NFT space.

Back in March, Starbucks, the renowned multinational coffee chain, made the decision to terminate its NFT rewards program.

In January, gaming retailer GameStop announced the closure of its NFT marketplace after scaling back its crypto services over the past two years.

More recently, X, under the ownership of Elon Musk, discontinued a feature that allowed premium users to use NFT images as their profile pictures.
Crypto owners are more inclined to support former President Donald Trump, while those without digital assets lean towards Vice President Kamala Harris.

According to a survey conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University’s (FDU) Poll, one in seven voters owns cryptocurrency.

The survey, led by Dan Cassino, professor of government and politics and executive director of the FDU Poll, found that among these, 50% support Trump, who has recently become a vocal advocate for digital currencies.

In contrast, only 38% of crypto holders back Harris.

Non-Crypto Owners Lean Toward Harris
The pattern is almost the opposite among non-crypto owners, where Harris has the support of 53%, compared to 41% for Trump.

The data also exposes a stark gender disparity in crypto ownership.


Men are more than twice as likely as women to have invested in digital assets.


Cassino suggests that for many men, particularly younger ones, cryptocurrency represents a way to fulfill traditional societal expectations of financial success and technological savvy.

“Crypto is seen as an avenue for young men to achieve what society demands—to make money, be providers, and navigate the complex world of finance and technology,” Cassino wrote in a recent Washington Post analysis.

Despite the slim chance of significant financial gains, many view crypto as a potential path to prosperity that traditional methods, such as education and hard work, do not seem to offer.

To further explore this intersection of gender, crypto, and political allegiance, the FDU poll delved into respondents’ views on masculinity.

Masculine Men Less Likely to Own Crypto
The poll revealed that men who identify as “completely masculine” are less likely to own cryptocurrency.

However, a surprising trend emerged among men who don’t see themselves as entirely masculine but still adhere to traditional notions of masculinity, such as believing men should be in charge.

This group, which Cassino describes as being caught in a “masculinity trap,” is more likely to invest in crypto and support Trump.

About a quarter of men fall into this category, and they are predominantly younger, Black, and Latino.

Among them, 37% own cryptocurrency, a significantly higher proportion compared to 18% among other men.

For these individuals, Trump’s anti-immigration stance, opposition to China, and critiques of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies resonate deeply.

Cassino argues that both crypto and Trump offer a kind of “false hope” for men who feel disconnected from traditional paths to success.

Trump’s recent overtures to the crypto community mark a sharp turn from his earlier skepticism.

After dismissing Bitcoin as a “scam,” he has embraced digital currencies more actively.

In a symbolic gesture, he purchased a burger with Bitcoin last week and unveiled a new crypto initiative, World Liberty Financial, alongside his sons, although they reportedly do not have ownership stakes in the venture.

At the Bitcoin 2024 conference, Trump made bold promises to strengthen the U.S. position in cryptocurrency, vowing to dismantle regulatory barriers and establish a national reserve of Bitcoin.

“The day I take the oath of office, Joe Biden’s and Kamala Harris’s anti-crypto crusade will be over,” he declared.

Trump’s pivot has even garnered the support of influential figures in Silicon Valley, including the founders of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

The former president’s campaign has also embraced crypto donations, although regulatory limits forced the return of $1 million in Bitcoin contributions from Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

People’s perceptions of money have undoubtedly shifted since the introduction of crypto. This is mostly because sending and receiving money using cryptocurrency is the simplest method.

Crypto transactions are fast and less expensive than traditional payment options. There is no middleman or bank to question or handle the transactions.

Accepting cryptocurrency for day-to-day operations, on the other hand, can be difficult due to its volatility. This is precisely where SpacePay comes in with its solution. How is it addressing that issue? Let us find out.

What is SpacePay?
SpacePay is a digital asset payment software solution. The project aims to close the gap between the old financial system and blockchain.

In order to fill this gap, SpacePay is providing a software solution that enables businesses to integrate cryptocurrency payments with their present card readers. Consumers may now make everyday purchases using digital currencies from over 325 wallets.

SpacePay is attempting to solve a few fundamental challenges that are currently affecting the traditional payment business. Security risks, privacy concerns, and a lack of transparency are some of the most prominent difficulties with centralized payment systems.


This is because typical payment systems prioritize convenience over speed, security, and privacy. It puts users at risk for data breaches and theft of identities. Additionally, there is also an absence of transparency in centralized systems. Users have virtually no control over their finances.

However, retailers are hesitant to accept crypto. This is due to technical obstacles, volatility risks, and a lack of awareness of its benefits. Although some payment options support cryptocurrency, they are confined to a few cryptos.


SpacePay’s solution to the community
To deal with all of these challenges, SpacePay has launched its payment system. It focuses on both users and merchants. SpacePay connects individuals to over 325 wallet providers.

This enables them to spend cryptocurrency at any merchant who has incorporated SpacePay. SpacePay offers merchants a cost-effective platform. SpacePay charges 0.5% transaction fees each transaction, which is lower than the greater rates charged by other notable payment systems.

Furthermore, SpacePay provides fast settlement with no waiting time. The platform ensures that payments are processed immediately. The next major problem that SpacePay addresses is volatility.

Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. SpacePay includes a volatility protection system. This is where the cryptocurrency is promptly changed to the merchant’s fiat currency, helping to prevent quick price changes.

Successful ongoing presale of the native token
The SpacePay project has completed multiple milestones in a short period of time.

It has raised $750,000 from private investors. Furthermore, they have effectively reinvested in their growth via a completed buy-back option. SpacePay also complies with regulatory requirements.

SpacePay also won the “New Payment Platform of the Year” category at the CorporateLiveWire Global Awards 2022/23. The presale for the project is still running, with over $400,000 already raised.

To purchase SPY tokens and become a part of this project, all you need is a compatible wallet like Coinbase, Best Wallet, or WalletConnect. You can then purchase SPY by linking your wallet to their website. Just make sure you have ETH, USDC, or USDT in your wallet.

The SPY coin is the foundation of the SpacePay platform. The token plays an important role in the ecosystem. SPY tokens help to incentivize user participation while also serving a variety of other objectives.

SPY token holders are going to be accepted into monthly loyalty airdrops to the most active wallets. Token holders are additionally receiving voting rights. This will let them vote once a month on major ideas, new features, and token-related choices.

The token’s overall supply cap is 34 billion. In this, 20% is kept aside for public sale. 17% of the tokens are allocated for user rewards and loyalty.

Furthermore, 10% is reserved for development, 5% for the founders, and 18% for partnerships and marketing. The last 12% is for reserve funds.

Eurozone and UK PMI data missed forecasts, causing market unease and shifting attention to upcoming U.S. PMI figures. As Bitcoin price tests a one-month high, traders anticipate potential volatility in both fiat and crypto markets.

Elon Musk’s recent meeting with El Salvador’s president also draws attention to Bitcoin’s expanding role in global finance, as key support and resistance levels come into focus.

Euro and UK PMI Data Misses, US PMI Awaited Amid Bitcoin Surge
As Eurozone and UK PMI data fall below expectations, global markets, including cryptocurrencies, are on alert. French and German manufacturing PMIs dipped to 44.0 and 40.3, respectively, raising concerns over broader economic stability.

As traders await the U.S. PMI data, set to impact traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could see increased volatility, depending on how the data shapes expectations around inflation and rate cuts.

Bitcoin Surges While Japan’s Vacation Leaves Other Currencies Steady
Following the Federal Reserve’s significant interest rate decrease last week, Bitcoin continued to surge on Monday, reaching a one-month high. At more than $63,818, it was up 0.39%. As Japan’s markets were closed for a vacation, the yen and other major currencies held steady.

The Bank of Japan’s decision to keep its interest rates unchanged helped strengthen the U.S. dollar, pushing it up to 144.08 against the yen. The anticipated rate cuts from the Fed, combined with gains in commodities and equities, have contributed to Bitcoin’s upward momentum. The U.S. dollar index also rose slightly, holding steady at 100.8.


Bitcoin’s continued rise reflects increased demand for riskier assets as investors look toward cryptocurrencies amid expectations of further U.S. interest rate reductions. This shift indicates a growing interest in alternatives to traditional currencies as the global financial landscape evolves.

Elon Musk Meets El Salvador’s President Amid Bitcoin Rally
As Bitcoin continues its price rally, Elon Musk recently revealed details of a private conversation with President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, a prominent advocate of the cryptocurrency.


During their discussion, which touched on the “future of humanity” and the role of technology, Musk—known for his influence in the crypto space—steered clear of directly mentioning Bitcoin.

Bukele, who made headlines in 2021 by adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, acknowledged that the country’s level of Bitcoin adoption has been challenging but remains optimistic, calling it a “net positive.”

He also highlighted key initiatives, such as Bitcoin-backed bonds and a citizenship program for overseas investors. Meanwhile, Tesla, led by Musk, now holds nearly 10,000 bitcoins, benefiting from the cryptocurrency’s rising value.


Musk’s ongoing involvement in the cryptocurrency space, paired with his high-profile meeting with Bukele, could further boost Bitcoin’s credibility and attract new investors. As market confidence builds around such influential endorsements, the potential for further price increases remains strong.

Following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points last week, Bitcoin has been trading at around $64,000, marking its highest point in nearly a month. The Fed’s rate cut—its first in four years—provided a lift to both traditional risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies, fueling further market optimism.

Bitcoin Price Outlook: Support and Resistance Levels
Bitcoin is trading at $63,420, down 0.22%, consolidating within a tightening range. The price remains above the 50-day EMA at $62,734, indicating potential upward momentum, though the RSI sits at 53, suggesting a neutral bias.

Immediate resistance is seen at $64,419, with further levels at $65,536 and $67,329 presenting key targets for bullish continuation.

A break above the $62,381 pivot point could signal a bullish reversal, while failure to hold this level may lead to a bearish shift. Support is expected at $61,287 and below.

Additionally, a bearish tweezer top formation near $64,500 raises caution for potential downside moves.

Key Levels to Watch: Bullish above $62,381, bearish below this level.
RSI Neutral: At 53, indicating indecision in market momentum.
Support & Resistance: immediate resistance at $64,419, with support at $61,287.
Bitcoin remains poised for directional moves depending on a breakout above or below key technical levels.

Travala, a cryptocurrency-based travel booking platform, has expanded its payment options to include major tokens from the Solana blockchain.

The announcement was made by Travala CEO Juan Otero on September 21 during the Solana Breakpoint conference in Singapore, according to a post by Solana’s official X account.

With this integration, Travala users can now book hotels and flights using Solana’s native token, SOL, as well as stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) running on the Solana network.

The move is expected to enhance the platform’s appeal among crypto enthusiasts who prefer the Solana blockchain for its high-speed and low-cost transactions.

Solana Gains Traction for its Efficiency
Solana, a direct competitor to Ethereum, has gained traction in the blockchain ecosystem for its efficiency in executing smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).

The collaboration with Travala underscores Solana’s growing influence and the increasing adoption of its network in real-world applications.


The new partnership also enables direct deposits and withdrawals of Solana-based tokens on Travala accounts, offering users a zero-fee transaction experience on travel bookings.

This integration is an upgrade from Travala’s existing support for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, providing more flexibility and reducing costs for users.


In a related development, crypto exchange Coinbase has also shown its support for Solana.

The company plans to introduce a wrapped Bitcoin asset, cbBTC, to the Solana network.

This product, currently available on Ethereum and Base, allows users to utilize Bitcoin as collateral in decentralized finance applications while retaining control over their assets.

Just recently, Franklin Templeton, managing over $1.4 trillion in assets, announced plans to launch a mutual fund natively on Solana.

Likewise, Citigroup is exploring the blockchain’s potential for smart contracts and cross-border payments.

Citigroup also sees Solana’s potential for cross-border money transfers and smart contract deployment.

The announcements were made at the Solana Breakpoint 2024 event in Singapore.

Solana Unveils New Seeker Smartphone
Last week, Solana officially introduced its latest smartphone, named “Seeker,” which the company touts as a significant leap forward for Web3 mobile technology.

Priced at roughly half the cost of its predecessor, Seeker aims to attract users with enhanced features and a broader appeal beyond just memecoin enthusiasts.

One of the key features of Seeker is its upgraded decentralized app (DApp) store, which aims to give developers a platform to quickly launch new applications.

Furthermore, the new model’s hardware upgrades are also intended to attract buyers.

The original Saga received criticism for its technical limitations compared to mainstream devices like the iPhone or Google Pixel.

Now, Seeker would come with a higher-quality screen, improved cameras, and a better battery, making it “lighter, brighter, and better” than its predecessor.
Bankroll Status, a BNB Chain-based decentralised finance (DeFi) platform, suffered a significant breach on Monday, resulting in a $230,000 loss. The hacking tactics appear to follow the same pattern as used in previous DualPools attacks.

Flagged by a cybersecurity firm, Cyvers Alerts, the infamous DualPools hacker group reportedly carried out the hack.

Shockingly, the evidence points to a smart contract deployed 90 days ago, which possibly served as the hacker’s entry point.

“Our system has detected malicious contract deployment targeting Bankroll 90 days ago,” the cybersecurity firm wrote on X.


Further, Cyvers has warned to users, urging them to secure their assets and prevent future attacks. However, the investigation into the exact mechanism of the hack is still ongoing.

The DualPools Threat Pattern
According to UEEx data, the attackers stole around $4.6 million worth of various cryptocurrencies from DualPools. The exploit drained around 750,000 Bitcoins in February 2024.


Following the hack, DualPools acknowledged the exploit and paused operations. Further, it implemented improved security measures for their hot wallets, however, specifics were not disclosed publicly.

According to cybersecurity experts, a vulnerability within Dualpools’ hot wallet security system allowed unauthorised access. Other possibilities include compromised server security and weak private key management.
Digital asset investment products experienced their second consecutive week of inflows, attracting a total of $321 million.

The increase in investment is believed to have been influenced by the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) recent decision to adopt a more dovish stance, including an unexpected 50 basis point interest rate cut, CoinShares said in a Monday report.

The move has spurred a wave of optimism across the market, leading to a 9% increase in total assets under management (AuM), which now stand at $9.5 billion.

US Leads In Terms of Inflows
From a regional perspective, the United States led the inflows with $277 million, while Switzerland followed with $63 million, marking its second-highest weekly inflows of the year.

However, not all regions experienced growth.

Germany, Sweden, and Canada saw outflows of $9.5 million, $7.8 million, and $2.3 million, respectively.


Bitcoin was the primary beneficiary, receiving $284 million in inflows.

Interestingly, short-bitcoin investment products also attracted $5.1 million, reflecting some hedging activity among investors.

Ethereum, however, continued its downward trend with outflows totaling $29 million for the fifth consecutive week, driven by withdrawals from the Grayscale Trust and limited interest in newly issued ETFs.

Solana, on the other hand, maintained steady inflows of $3.2 million, showing resilience amid market volatility.


Harris Shows Support for Crypto
Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has voiced support for emerging technologies, emphasizing plans to boost investment in AI and digital assets.

In a recent note, QCP Capital said Harris’ pro-crypto comments have sparked renewed optimism in the digital asset market.

Over the weekend, during a fundraiser, Harris pledged to support the growth of the cryptocurrency sector.

Her remarks come as a strategic move to appeal to the crypto community, with high-profile figures like Anthony Scaramucci backing her campaign’s crypto policies.

Harris’s statements, combined with positive macroeconomic factors, have given the crypto market a significant boost, leading to almost $60 million in short liquidations at the start of the week.

The surge aligns with predictions from QCP Capital, which previously anticipated a potential 13.8% rally in Bitcoin from its lows of $57,500.

Since last Monday, Bitcoin has rebounded nearly 12%, currently trading around $63,500, and appears poised for further gains.

The market’s sentiment shift is also evident in the options market.

The usual frontend Put skew observed over the past month is beginning to normalize, as more buyers are looking to capitalize on topside options while sellers are offloading downside risks.

Additionally, funding rates on major exchanges are improving, and basis yields are becoming more attractive, especially in light of recent interest rate cuts.

For investors looking to capitalize on this bullish momentum heading into the fourth quarter, QCP Capital suggests considering a Principal Protected Sharkfin product.

This investment offers a potential return of over 96% per annum with no downside risk, maturing on December 27, 2024, with a strike price of $80,000 and a barrier of $100,000, based on a current spot price of $63,500.
Ethereum ($ETH) Dominance in Freefall
ETH holders are growing ever more concerned that the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin is losing market share to faster Layer 1 chains such as Solana. Ethereum dominance has recently fallen and is currently below 14%, signaling that more and more crypto users are ditching Ethereum to move to other chains.

The ETH/BTC ratio has also fallen more than 27% over the last 3 months, meaning that investors would have been better off holding Bitcoin. Analysts point to the Ethereum ETFs being hugely underwhelming in recent weeks, as outflows have totaled $581 million. Should this continue, Ethereum’s price could experience a drawback.

Ripple ($XRP) Uncertainty Puts a Dampener On Price
Ripple’s XRP gained 3% this week as the $XRP price continues to push against resistance at $0.58. The token’s price recently fell to $0.50 but has since rebounded as markets reacted to news of the recent Ripple settlement with the SEC.

Ripple Labs was hit with a fine of just $125 million, which is getting off lightly as many insiders had expected Ripple to face billions of dollars of fines as the court case drew to a close. Ripple continues to remain volatile as regulatory uncertainty remains, and many investors seek more upside elsewhere.

Rollblock ($RBLK) Hits New Highs As Investors Score Huge Wins
Stage 6 of the extremely well-performing Rollblock ($RBLK) casino presale is currently selling out fast and is over 78% sold out. The fact that the project has raised over $3.7 million since the start of its presale could be attributed to Rollblock’s approach to the crypto casino industry, attempting to address many of the problems faced by the online gambling community.

Specifically, the casino uses blockchain technology to anonymously encrypt all transactions onto the blockchain, reducing any risk of bet fixing or manipulated bids. This reliance on Web3 technology also makes for a secure and KYC-free onboarding process. Instead of having to verify their identity, gamers can sign in with an email address and connect a compatible crypto to get started.

All payouts and winnings are made using the native $RBLK, giving the token a purpose in the casino economy right from the get-go. $RBLK can also be staked on the platform for up to 30% in yield. Each week, the casino takes a portion of its profits to the open market to buy up $RBLK, removing a noteworthy sum of tokens on a consistent basis. This buyback system ensures a consistent decrease in supply, which could affect the price in a positive way.

Rollblock’s success with both its presale and active user count certainly brings a positive outlook to the project. With the current presale price of $0.027 and analysts calling the project “the first GambleFi token to break into the top 10 cryptos by market cap before 2028,” Rollblock looks incredibly promising in the mid to long-term.
Online trading has become very popular in recent years, as advances in technology have helped lower barriers to entry for retail traders of all sizes. No matter the size of the trader, one thing they all agree upon is the importance of safety and security when entering the markets online. This applies to their funds, as well as their personal data. Traders look to work with brokers that provide added layers of security, so they can feel confident every time they place a trade.

One leading Crypto & CFD broker committed to ensuring one of the safest trading environments for its clients is PrimeXBT. Known for being very client-focused, the broker employs various measures that provide high security to its traders, including offering negative balance protection (NBP), a compensation fund, and using the latest cybersecurity technology. This article will look at the measures PrimeXBT has in place, and how it can help clients feel safe when trading online.

Traders Don’t Lose More Than Their Deposits

By offering negative balance protection (NBP), PrimeXBT protects client accounts from falling into a negative balance. This means that traders with the broker can never lose more than the money they deposit. It can also empower traders, giving them more confidence to seek opportunities in volatile markets, knowing there’s a limit to the losses they could experience if things don’t go their way.

While NBP is a benefit to have, it should always be paired with a robust risk management strategy. PrimeXBT recognises this fact, also providing clients with a range of trading tools to help manage risk, including limit orders like stop loss and take profit. By making use of these tools, traders can minimise the risk involved with their trades, while knowing NBP has them covered if the markets swing wildly against them.

Clients Can Benefit from $20,000 Compensation Fund

PrimeXBT is also a member of the Financial Commission, a well-known organisation that helps in external dispute resolution. The Commission acts as a fair and neutral third party when traders may have complaints about their brokers that can’t be resolved simply between the two parties. In such cases, if the Commission rules in favour of the trader, they could earn up to a maximum of $20,000 in compensation through the related fund.

Of course, the fund doesn’t cover losses incurred from a trader’s own actions. It does, however, provide clients with an added level of safety when it comes to their funds. This also proves PrimeXBT’s commitment to providing its traders with the safest and most secure environment in which to trade.

Cybersecurity Technology Protects Personal Data

PrimeXBT is well-known for being innovative when it comes to technology, as can be seen with its unique, all-in-one trading platform. This commitment to innovation is also present in the broker’s approach to security, where a comprehensive cybersecurity framework and strict measures are in place to protect clients against possible threats.

On the account side, this includes features like two-factor authentication, cryptographically hashed passwords, and complex data encryption. The broker’s website also features secure socket layer encryption, while all client touch points undergo regular stress tests to identify and fix any security weaknesses. For asset protection, PrimeXBT offers multi-signature cold storage options alongside high-level security modules, as well as doing detailed risk management for every client order. All of this added security helps provide traders with a safer environment in which to operate.

Conclusion: Making Online Trading Safe for Clients

When it comes to anything involving money, people want to feel safe and confident. By focusing on providing additional security measures and safety nets, online brokers can attract a wider audience. This includes traders looking for investment options that provide more possibilities when it comes to managing their risks.

PrimeXBT is already at the forefront of this, offering its clients a wide range of safety and security features that go above and beyond the basic requirements. This commitment to client safety, along with all the broker’s other competitive conditions, makes it an attractive choice for traders everywhere.
StepN Go, a social lifestyle app, has announced a second collaboration with German sports footwear retailer Adidas to launch a non-fungible token (NFT) sneaker collection, Genesis, on the Solana blockchain.

The StepN Go and Adidas Genesis Sneakers NFT drop is the latest collaboration between the two brands, following the successful launch of their initial partnership in April 2024. This second phase of the year-long partnership aims to further blend fitness and digital fashion in the Web3 space.

The new Genesis Sneakers collection will be available exclusively through a raffle mint on MOOAR, an NFT marketplace of FLS, a gaming and development studio behind StepN. A total of 1,000 sneakers will be up for grabs at 10,000 GMT, StepN Go’s native token, per entry, with a refund provided for those who don’t win.


New Features Fuel StepN Go’s Growth
Since its public beta launch in Sept. 2024, StepN Go has gained traction with its innovative features. One such feature, the Haus, allows users to lend their sneakers to friends, sharing their earnings while motivating each other to stay active.

Beyond the Haus feature, StepN Go offers a variety of features designed to reward users for their physical activity. The Fitness Level feature, for example, provides additional earnings based on consistent activity, turning every step into an opportunity to earn more.

To support the new features, StepN Go launched a new token, the Go Game Token (GGT). Similar to the Green Satoshi Token (GST), GGT can be earned by walking, jogging, and running with digital sneakers.

The app also features key social elements such as adding friends, messaging, avatars, and various playing options. These features allow players to connect with others, share their experiences, and earn GMT rewards.

The original StepN app was launched in 2021 and is one of the biggest move-to-earn games.

German Companies Embrace NFTs
Reflecting the growing interest in NFTs, traditional German companies are exploring innovative ways to leverage the technology.

One example is Lufthansa and its NFT loyalty program on the Polygon network. In collaboration with the Lufthansa Innovation Hub and Miles & More, its frequent flyer program, Lufthansa launched the Uptrip mobile application. This app allows passengers to convert their travel experiences into NFTs, which can then be redeemed for rewards such as mileage bonuses and business lounge vouchers.


German fashion brand Hugo Boss also joined the growing trend of NFTs by focusing on fashion in the metaverse. The company collaborated with renowned digital fashion designers to create a series of exclusive NFT clothing items. These digital fashion pieces can be worn by avatars in virtual worlds, providing users with the opportunity to express their style and individuality even in the digital realm.

Hugo Boss also introduced HUGO BOSS XP, an omnichannel member experience powered by blockchain technology. Launched in May 2024, the program allows members to collect and redeem NFTs through their purchases and interactions across channels and brands. These tokens act as keys to unlock exclusive products, brand events and other offers from two separate labels, BOSS and HUGO, or their partners.
However, Injective and Aave are not the only projects that are making headlines; BlockDAG is one of the projects that also snuck into the limelight. Following its high-profile partnerships with Borussia Dortmund and Inter Milan, rumors are swirling that BlockDAG is now targeting a deal with a Premier League club in England. Combined with its presale success, where the project raised over $74.5 million in just a few months, this momentum is pushing BlockDAG closer to potentially reaching the $1 mark.

Injective Protocol Price Outlook: Will It Reach $20?
Injective Protocol ($INJ) has been on an upward trend, with its price hovering around $12. According to Changelly’s $INJ price prediction, the token could break through the $20 barrier by the end of 2024, driven by the growth of the broader DeFi sector.

However, reaching this milestone will depend on various factors, including market adoption and platform developments. If market conditions align, Injective could exceed its previous highs, solidifying its place in the DeFi space.

Aave Founder’s Token Sale Raises Questions
In other news, Aave’s founder, Stani Kulechov, recently sold $6.7 million worth of $AAVE tokens, raising eyebrows in the crypto community. This sale coincided with a significant price increase, as $AAVE jumped 66% over the past month.

Despite the sale, Kulechov still holds a substantial amount of $AAVE tokens, worth roughly $32.7 million, showing his investment in the project.

aave
Aave’s recent price surge can be attributed to the launch of Aave V3 on the Era Mainnet. The upgrade incorporates ZKsync technology to enhance scalability, privacy, and security. While these upgrades have boosted confidence in Aave, Kulechov’s sale has introduced some uncertainty about the long-term outlook of the project.

BlockDAG’s Soccer Partnerships & Potential ROI Opportunity
BlockDAG is making waves in the crypto space thanks to its recent deals with major soccer clubs and a highly successful presale. After securing partnerships with Inter Milan and Borussia Dortmund, rumors are circulating that the project is eyeing a deal with another club, this time from the English Premier League. If this happens, it could significantly expand BlockDAG’s global reach and cement its place as a key player in the sports and blockchain industries.

BlockDAG’s soccer partnerships have given it “premium partner” status, along with virtual LED advertising rights and branded content featuring star players from Borussia Dortmund and Inter Milan. This has provided BlockDAG with unparalleled global exposure, introducing soccer fans to the world of blockchain. Now, with speculation of a Premier League deal on the horizon, BlockDAG’s visibility is expected to grow even further, potentially bringing in a wave of new users.

blockdag raised over $70 million
The success of these partnerships is reflected in BlockDAG’s presale, which has raised $74.5 million so far. Early holders of $BDAG coins from batch 1 have already seen gains of over 1820%, with the coin’s price rising from $0.001 to $0.0192.

Experts predict that $BDAG could potentially break the $1 price point in 2025, potentially offering an impressive 5108% return for those who join now. This upward momentum is currently being fueled by BlockDAG’s rapid growth and high-profile partnerships, making it one of the most talked-about projects in the crypto space.

What’s Next?
BlockDAG’s momentum is certainly hard to miss, with rumors of an upcoming partnership with a Premier League club adding to its recent achievements with Borussia Dortmund and Inter Milan.

While Injective Protocol ($INJ) nears the $20 mark and Aave’s founder makes waves with significant token sales, BlockDAG is drawing attention for its impressive presale, which has raised $74.5 million.
As Dogecoin (DOGE) investors prepare to take profits on Monday following a notable technical breakout, many are turning their attention to a new ICO called Mega Dice (DICE) in the GambleFi space.

DOGE recently broke above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and a key downward trend channel, signaling the potential for a substantial rally.


Source: TradingView / DOGEUSD
With the Dogecoin price currently around $0.1060, investors are eyeing a potential move to yearly highs of $0.22.

As excitement builds, many Dogecoin holders are considering where to reinvest their profits, and Mega Dice’s new ICO has caught their attention.

Alternative Options in GambleFi
The online gambling industry has long been marred by concerns over transparency and fraud.

Blockchain-based platforms are emerging as a solution, offering transparency through open ledgers and smart contracts.


GambleFi is one of the fastest-growing sectors within crypto, with platforms like Stake.com and Rollbit becoming well-known names.

However, a new player, Mega Dice, is gaining traction. This recently launched ICO is built into the popular encrypted messaging app Telegram, giving it access to the app’s 700 million monthly users.

This strategic integration offers easy entry into the world of GambleFi, with Mega Dice quickly establishing itself as one of the top Telegram-based casinos.

What Mega Dice’s New ICO Brings to GambleFi
Despite its recent launch, Mega Dice has already attracted over 10,000 monthly users and processed $50 million in wagers.

Now, the platform is expanding its Web3 integration with the launch of its native token, DICE, currently available in a new ICO.


The DICE token offers users cashback benefits on their wagers and access to limited-edition NFTs.

Mega Dice is also running one of the most anticipated airdrops in crypto, offering a share of $750,000 to platform users.

In addition, the ICO includes a staking feature with yields currently reaching up to 290% APY, appealing to DeFi enthusiasts and affiliate marketers alike.


The DICE token will be officially launched on Solana’s decentralized exchange, Raydium, in seven days, and investors are moving quickly to secure their tokens during the presale.

How High Can Mega Dice Go?
Crypto enthusiasts have been closely following Mega Dice’s ICO, with many speculating that the DICE token has the potential to outperform major cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin in the coming years.

Analysts such as Crypto June, ALROCK, and Zach Humpries have drawn attention to the possibility that DICE could rival platforms like Rollbit.

Zach Humpries believes the new ICO could yield returns of at least 10x, while others, like DeFi Shaun, have predicted even more optimistic gains, up to 1000x.


While such predictions might seem ambitious, Mega Dice’s rapid growth and the ongoing expansion of the GambleFi sector give it a strong foundation for potential growth.

Even if the highest estimates are not reached, the DICE token’s potential for substantial returns has generated considerable interest within the crypto community.
In response to mounting investor concerns over the security and transparency of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), BlackRock has amended its agreement with Coinbase, demanding that the crypto custodian process Bitcoin withdrawals within 12 hours.

This move comes as the world’s largest asset manager attempts to address fears over Coinbase’s on-chain settlement practices. It focuses particularly on proof of reserve transparency.

BlackRock Amends for Faster Coinbase Withdrawals: What Is Going On?
On September 16, BlackRock filed an amendment to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), outlining new terms for Bitcoin withdrawals related to its ETF products.

The amendment mandates that Coinbase, the custodian for BlackRock’s ETF assets, process Bitcoin withdrawals to a public blockchain address within 12 hours of receiving instructions from clients or authorized representatives.

The goal is to reassure investors that their assets are being appropriately managed and that there is no undue delay in accessing Bitcoin holdings.

In the filing, BlackRock emphasized,

“Subject to confirmation of the foregoing required minimum balance, Coinbase Custody shall process a withdrawal of Digital Assets from the Custodial Account to a public blockchain address within 12 hours of obtaining an instruction from Client or Client’s Authorized Representatives.”


Source: Sec.Gov
Investor Concerns: Is Coinbase Transparent?
The demand for increased transparency and faster withdrawals was catalyzed by widespread speculation that Coinbase was potentially purchasing “paper BTC” or Bitcoin IOUs on behalf of Bitcoin ETF issuers.


This rumor, combined with Bitcoin’s stagnating price over the past three months, led many investors to question the integrity of the Bitcoin ETF system and Coinbase’s role as the primary custodian for these products.

In August, investor worries were further fueled when Coinbase announced the development of a new Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), dubbed Coinbase BTC (cbBTC).

Some feared it could be linked to a system of IOUs rather than actual Bitcoin.

Responding to these concerns, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to social media to address the accusations.

In a September 14 post on X, Armstrong wrote,

“This is what it looks like if you want a bunch of institutional money to flow into Bitcoin.”


Armstrong’s statement clarified that all ETF transactions are ultimately settled on-chain.

However, Coinbase has refrained from publicly sharing all ETF wallet addresses due to confidentiality agreements with institutional clients.

He reassured investors that Coinbase undergoes regular audits and operates transparently within the regulatory framework expected of a publicly traded company.

According to Dune Analytics, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) had captured over 38% of the total Bitcoin ETF market, with over $22.5 billion in on-chain holdings.


Source: Dune Analytics
Collectively, Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated more than $59.2 billion in assets, showing the growing demand for institutional Bitcoin products.

In a September 15 post, Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg senior ETF analyst also dismissed the theory that Bitcoin’s recent price slump was linked to ETF activity, instead pointing to native Bitcoin holders as the primary sellers.

He stated;

“All the ETFs and BlackRock have done is save BTC’s price from the abyss repeatedly.”

The introduction of ETFs has brought significant institutional inflows into the Bitcoin market, accounting for 75% of new investments in early 2024.


However, the increased attention from large asset managers like BlackRock has also resulted in heightened scrutiny from investors demanding greater transparency and assurance that their investments are secure.
Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) reached another significant presale milestone over the weekend, achieving a total of over $1.5 million in funding.

This influx of capital coincided with meme coins pushing their collective market value from $41 billion to over $43 billion on Sunday, with First Neiro on Ethereum ($NEIRO) extending its pump by 40% on Monday, continuing to feel the effects of its recent Binance listing.

As Crypto All-Stars continues to see presale success, it is getting closer to launching its unified meme coin staking platform, designed to powercharge the returns of the meme coin sector.

Meme coins such as Turbo ($TURBO) and PepeCoin ($PEPECOIN), which have achieved seven-day returns of 28.48% and 56%, respectively, can receive an even bigger boost through Crypto All-Stars’ MemeVault.

But even before MemeVault launches, investors can already become whale holders of its native token, $STARS, which is essential for maximizing passive income returns from the staking platform.

In the ongoing presale, $STARS is selling at a fixed presale price of $0.0014593 per token – a bargain considering its potential for substantial price appreciation due to its unparalleled utility.


However, the opportunity to secure $STARS at this price will close in less than 48 hours, increasing to $0.0014652 to accommodate the next funding round.

What Binance effect? Watch out for the MemeVault effect
$NEIRO’s listing on Binance is arguably one of the key meme coin-centric catalysts for the sector’s recent resurgence.

The token’s listing on the world’s largest exchange sparked chatter across the space. The move was surprising given that $NEIRO’s market capitalization pre-listing was only $15 million and the fact that a different Neiro token was listed on Binance Futures.

From ballooning to over a $150 million market cap, all $NEIRO tokens reached a $500 million price tag on Monday.

The Binance effect is indeed working its magic for $NEIRO, much like it has for other Binance ICOs.

Being listed on the world’s largest crypto exchange has its perks, and the majority of coins listed by Binance tend to experience a positive impact on their prices, as seen in the chart below:


Source: Ren & Heinrich (Coinmonks)
All but a handful of tokens have experienced huge upswings in the initial days following their listings, with some gains persisting beyond the first five days.

With the launch of MemeVault, a similar effect could apply to the tokens that users can stake on the platform – a MemeVault effect.

As mentioned, MemeVault is a staking protocol explicitly designed for meme coins to generate passive income collectively. It is the first in the industry to offer such a capability, making the next meme coin eligible for staking on its platform a game-changing event to watch.

Currently, it accepts Dogecoin ($DOGE), Shiba Inu ($SHIB), $PEPECOIN, Milady Meme Coin ($LADYS), the newly Binance-listed Turbo ($TURBO), Floki ($FLOKI), and several others. A complete list is available on the project’s official website.

Holders of these tokens are definitely riding the wave of the sector’s recent buoyancy, but they’ll be jumping for joy once MemeVault goes live.

MemeVault can provide thrice the regular staking returns through $STARS
The $STARS token holds the key to amplifying the MemeVault effect. As a meme token itself, it boasts unmatched utility, serving as a rewards multiplier for MemeVault stakers.

Investors holding large quantities of $STARS can ramp up their staking rewards, with larger holdings allowing rewards to multiply threefold.

This is likely why early investors are scooping up as many $STARS as possible while on presale so their meme coin holdings can extract the maximum rewards MemeVault gives them. That’s why if $NEIRO lands a staking spot on MemeVault, aside from feeling the Binance effect, investors will also feel the juiced-up MemeVault effect if they are holding $STARS.

The $STARS gold rush is even magnified by the early contributors taking advantage of Crypto All-Stars’ independent $STARS staking protocol, which currently offers a whopping 968% APY. Currently, people have already staked about 763 million $STARS – reflecting a 10% jump since Friday.

With a hefty staking bounty, early contributors can effortlessly boost their holdings, positioning themselves in the front row for MemeVault’s rewards.

Indeed, with Crypto All-Stars, investors have not only capital gains to look forward to but also passive income – an unmatched utility that both investors and crypto influencers are starting to recognize.

For instance, Cilinix Crypto shares the same sentiment about Crypto All-Stars’ utility and believes that $STARS could see significant growth.


What if Crypto All-Stars gets listed on Binance?
The million-dollar question is: what if $STARS gets onto Binance?

As a token people are primarily meant to hold or stake – essential for maximizing staking rewards via MemeVault – it already has strong economics in place.

A Binance listing in this case would flood the token with liquidity to catapult it to the moon ala $NEIRO.

So, while it is available at its discounted ICO price, early contributors can be ahead of the curve.

Now that the project has hit the $1.5 million target, the next goal is $2 million, which is very achievable before the end of the week.

Visit Crypto All-Stars website and connect your wallet to join the presale. You can exchange ETH, USDT, or BNB for $STARS, and even use meme coins like $FLOKI, $SHIB, $DOGE, and $PEPE. Secure bank card payments are also available through an easy-to-use widget.

Coinsult and SolidProof completed a full audit of the Crypto All-Stars smart contract, identifying zero critical issues in the code.
Bitfarms and Riot Platforms announced on September 23, 2024, that they have reached a settlement agreement involving new board appointments and a standstill arrangement lasting until 2026.


According to a press release shared with Cryptonews, the agreement will see Andrés Finkielsztain stepping down from Bitfarms’ board, with Amy Freedman joining as a new director.

Settlement Agreement Between Bitfarms and Riot Platforms
The agreement includes Riot withdrawing its previous requisition and restricting its actions until the 2026 Bitfarms Annual Meeting, with a few outlined exceptions.

This standstill agreement is aimed at ensuring stability within Bitfarms’ governance structure over the next two years.

Additionally, Bitfarms will propose expanding its board from five to six members at a special meeting, where shareholders will vote on the new independent director nominee.


“We recognize the importance of refreshment and having the right mix of skills, experience and diversity, and we are always open to adding qualified candidates with valuable insights and perspectives to strengthen our Board,” said Independent Chairman Brian Howlett.

Future Plans and Upcoming Meeting
The agreement also grants Riot certain rights to purchase additional shares in Bitfarms, provided it maintains a holding of 15% or more of the company’s outstanding common shares.

Bitfarms has outlined a shareholder rights plan that will be voted on at the upcoming special meeting.

This plan seeks to provide a structured approach for any potential changes in ownership of Bitfarms shares.

“We remain focused on diversifying the business beyond Bitcoin mining into exciting and synergistic new areas like energy generation, energy trading, heat recycling and other high value revenue streams like HPC/AI,” said Bitfarms CEO Ben Gagnon.

The special meeting, originally scheduled for November 6, may be postponed to accommodate these new proposals. However, Bitfarms has assured shareholders that the meeting will not be delayed beyond November 20, and updates will be provided as they become available.

Federal Court Fined New York Man $36 Million for Crypto Fraud
In a recent case, a U.S. federal court has ordered William Koo Ichioka, a New York resident, to pay over $36 million in restitution and penalties after being found guilty of orchestrating a fraudulent cryptocurrency and foreign exchange investment scheme.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has tightened its grip on the cryptocurrency market, led the case.

Crypto Fraud: Ichioka’s $36 Million Fine and 48 Months Jail Time
Judge Vince Chhabria of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ordered Ichioka to pay $31 million in restitution to victims and an additional $5 million in civil penalties.

The court found Ichioka guilty of running a deceptive scheme between 2018 and 2021. In this scheme, he lured investors with promises of guaranteed returns—specifically, 10% every 30 business days.

The fraudulent promises attracted substantial investment, which Ichioka partially used for foreign currency and digital asset trading.

However, much of the funds were funneled into his lifestyle, with expenditures on luxury items such as watches, jewelry, high-end vehicles, and rent for his residence.


The court’s decision follows an earlier consent order from August 2023, which permanently banned Ichioka from trading in markets regulated by the CFTC and prohibited him from registering with the commission in the future.

In addition to the restitution order, Ichioka will also serve 48 months in prison, followed by five years of supervised release.


The Fraudulent Scheme: A Classic Crypto Ponzi Scheme
Ichioka’s fraudulent scheme began in 2018 when he promised investors exceptionally high and unrealistic investment returns, a classic red flag for Ponzi schemes.

According to court documents, while some funds were indeed invested in forex and cryptocurrencies as promised, Ichioka commingled the funds with his personal accounts. He diverted significant amounts to cover personal expenses.

The court noted that Ichioka went to great lengths to conceal his fraudulent activities by creating false financial documents and issuing fake account statements to investors, making it appear that their investments were performing well.

This classic Ponzi scheme structure, where old investors are paid returns using new investors’ capital, allowed Ichioka to continue deceiving participants for several years.

The fraudulent returns and false documentation kept investors in the dark until the scheme began to unravel under regulatory scrutiny.

In June 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also charged Ichioka with several criminal offenses, including wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud, and filing false tax returns.

On the same day, Ichioka pled guilty to all charges and was sentenced to 48 months in federal prison, alongside the financial penalties and restitution ordered by the CFTC.

The case against Ichioka is not the first or new. The CFTC, in collaboration with other U.S. regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the DOJ, has ramped up efforts to hold individuals accountable for misleading investors in a market they deem almost illegal.

A recent report reveals that U.S. residents lost an estimated $5.6 billion to cryptocurrency fraud in 2023, a 45% increase from the previous year.

Regulators are particularly concerned about fraudulent schemes that prey on older investors.

The same report cites data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) showing that individuals over the age of 60 were disproportionately targeted, accounting for nearly $1.6 billion in losses.
he Solana price has dipped today to $143.82, marking a 1% decline in 24 hours as the cryptocurrency market as a whole barely moves.

SOL remains up by 9% in a week, and while it’s down by 7% in a month the past few days have seen the launch of a prototype of its new Firedancer validator client.

Once fully deployed, Firedancer will improve Solana’s scalability and reliability, with the recently launched test version already clocking more than 1.4 million transactions per second.

Given Solana’s existing size, speed and popularity, the new validator could see it pose a real risk to Ethereum’s status as the biggest layer-one network in crypto, while helping pushing the Solana price to new heights.

Solana Price Analysis: Firedancer Launch Could Be a Game-Changer for SOL
Solana’s indicators are a little mixed today, struggling to recapture some of the stronger momentum we saw last week.

For instance, its 30-period moving average (orange) had risen above the 200-period average (blue) on the 19th, but it now looks as though it’s losing impetus and could fall below the longer term average soon.

Likewise, its RSI (purple) dipped to 30 last night and, despite a brief resurgence this morning, has dropped below 50 again.


This would suggest that SOL is a near-term transitional phase, with traders unsure of where it could be going next.

But while the Solana price may sink a little further in the next one or two days, the medium- and long-term picture remains overwhelmingly positive.

As mentioned above, the test version of the upcoming Firedancer validator launched last week, deployed by Jump Crypto and dubbed Frankendancer.


It’s now regularly topping 1 million transactions per second, while improving on Solana’s reliability, which in recent years has been an issue.

Not only did Solana suffer numerous outages in 2022 (and one this year), but it continues to see a high proportion of failed transactions, particularly in comparison with Ethereum.

However, Firedancer will address such concerns, by diversifying Solana’s codebase and also laying foundations for sharing.

Such improvements will put Solana in a great position to continue expanding, with its blockchain already being the third-biggest in the sector in terms of value locked in.

By extension, we’re likely to witness greater demand for SOL, which will certainly push up the Solana price over time.

It could hit $200 by the end of November and $250 by the end of the year.

New Alts with Fundamentals Also Show Strong Potential Upside
Solana one of the most promising major tokens in the market right now, but traders looking to widen their portfolios would also do well to consider some smaller cap alts as well.

This should include recently launched tokens, as well as presale coins, which often outperform the market when they first list.

One of the most interesting presale coins at the moment is Memebet Token (MEMEBET), an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has raised $250,000 after launching its sale a couple of weeks ago.


Due to launch very soon, Memebet will combine an online crypto-friendly casino with its own native MEMEBET token, which will enable users to earn greater rewards if they place bets using it.

Its casino will offer more than 1,000 crypto-native games to play, as well as the ability to bet on a wide variety of sporting events.

In addition to placing bets with MEMEBET, users will also be able to deposit and withdraw using established meme coins such as Pepe, Dogecoin, Bonk and Shiba Inu.

As well as a web-based casino, Memebet will also be launching a KYC-free Telegram casino, making signing up more accessible.


Joining the coin’s sale is easy, with investors simply needing to go to the official Memebet Token website and connect their wallets.

1 MEMEBET currently costs $0.0253, with this price rising by $0.001 with every new stage of the sale.

It’s encouraging to note that Memebet has already grown a sizeable online community, with its X account now having over 13,000 followers.

This suggests it could rally big once it launches its casino and lists its coin on trading platforms.
